.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tfdomains
Administers the relationship between a 20ft web gateway and which domains are available for you to redirect.

The process of claiming a domain takes place in two steps:

.TP
.BR Preparing
20ft will return a token that must be added as a subdomain text record to the domain. Once this has happened you have two hours to complete the process.
.TP
.BR Claiming
