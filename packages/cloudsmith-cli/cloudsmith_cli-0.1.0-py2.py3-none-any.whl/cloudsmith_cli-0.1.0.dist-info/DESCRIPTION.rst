Cloudsmith Command Line Interface (CLI)
=======================================

The `Cloudsmith <https://cloudsmith.io>`__ Command Line Interface (CLI)
is a Py2/Py3 text-based interface to the
`API <https://api.cloudsmith.io>`__. This allows users, machines and
other services to access and integrate smoothly with Cloudsmith without
requiring explicit plugins or tools.

Features
--------

The CLI currently supports the following commands:

-  ``check``: Check the status/version of the service.
-  ``delete``: Delete a package from a repository.
-  ``docs``: Launch the help website in your browser.
-  ``push``: Push/upload a new package to a repository.
-  ``status``: Get the synchronisation status for a package.
-  ``token``: Retrieve your API authentication token/key.
-  ``whoami``: Retrieve your current authentication status.

Configuration
-------------

There are two configuration files used by the CLI:

-  ``config.ini``: For non-credentials configuration.
-  ``credentials.ini``: For credentials (authentication) configuration.

By default, the CLI will look for these in the following locations:

-  The current working directory.
-  A directory called ``cloudsmith`` in the OS-defined application
   directory. For example:
-  Linux: ``$HOME/.config/cloudsmith``

   -  Windows: ``C:\Users\YourName\AppData\cloudsmith``

Both configuration files use the simple INI format, such as:

::

    # Default configuration
    [default]
    api_key='1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef'

    # Profile-based configuration (not working yet)
    [profile:cloudsmith]
    api_key='fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321'

Non-Credentials (config.ini)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODO

Credentials (credentials.ini)

You can specify the following configuration options:

-  ``api_key``: To specify the authentication key/token for API access.
