        Installation
        ------------------------
        
        The easiest way to install lcoptview is via conda. This ensures the version of Python (3.6) is correct, all of the dependencies are correct and there are no conflicts.
        
        If you have conda installed, you can do it in one command.
        
        If you don't, first install miniconda (available [here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html))
        
        Then, on the command line/console, create a new environment called lcoptview and install lcoptview with this command
        ```
            conda create -n lcoptview -c pjamesjoyce python=3.6 lcoptview
        ```
        Launch lcoptview
        ----------------
        
        1) Activate the lcoptview environment using one of these
        ```
            # Mac/Linux
            source activate lcoptview
            # Windows
            activate lcoptview
        ```
        2) Launch lcoptview by typing
        ```
        	lcoptview
        ```
        
        You'll see this dialog
        
        ![lcoptview launcher](/img/launcher.jpg)
        
        Click on the button and choose an .lcoptview file.
        
        Your default browser will open up, and you can explore the model and results.
