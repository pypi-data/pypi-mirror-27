ITK is an open-source, cross-platform library that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis. Developed through extreme programming methodologies, ITK employs leading-edge algorithms for registering and segmenting multidimensional scientific images.

These packages contains filters that modify data in the ITK pipeline framework.  These filters take an input object, such as an Image, and modify it to create an output.  Filters can be chained together to create a processing pipeline.
