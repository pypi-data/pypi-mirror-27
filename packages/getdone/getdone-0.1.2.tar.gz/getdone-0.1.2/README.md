## Installation
Get done can be installed with `pip install getdone` from inside the project directory. This will ensure that you can run `gd` or `td` to call the invoke Get Done.

## How to Use
After installation you have access to commands `gd` and `td`. They both do the same thing. So, you can use which ever is more mnemonically easy to remember.

**Examples**:
Adding a new task:
```
$ gd Get groceries from the market
Task 'Get groceries from the market' added
```
Show existing tasks:
```
$ gd
TODO: Get groceries from the market
```
When there are no more tasks TODO
```
$ td
No TODO's present
You are all caught up. Yay!
```
