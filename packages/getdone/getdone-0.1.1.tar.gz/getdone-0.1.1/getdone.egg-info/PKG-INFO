        An integrated ToDo list manager for your commandline
        
        ![Get Done](get_done.png)
        
        ## Installation
        Get done can be installed with `pip install getdone` from inside the project directory. This will ensure that you can run `gd` or `td` to call the invoke Get Done.
        
        ## How to Use
        After installation you have access to commands `gd` and `td`. They both do the same thing. So, you can use which ever is more mnemonically easy to remember.
        
        **Examples**:
        Adding a new task:
        ```
        $ gd Get groceries from the market
        Task 'Get groceries from the market' added
        ```
        Show existing tasks:
        ```
        $ gd
        TODO: Get groceries from the market
        ```
        When there are no more tasks TODO
        ```
        $ td
        No TODO's present
        You are all caught up. Yay!
        ```
