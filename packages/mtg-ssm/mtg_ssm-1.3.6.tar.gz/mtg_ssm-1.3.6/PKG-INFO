        `mtg-ssm`_ is a tool for creating/updating user-friendly spreadsheets with
        Magic: the Gathering collection information. The tool can also
        import/export data to/from these spreadsheets to other formats, such as
        CSV files.
        
        .. _mtg-ssm: https://github.com/gwax/mtg_ssm
        
        As a matter of convenience, you can store the created spreadsheet in
        Dropbox, Google Drive, or the like and access your collection from
        anywhere.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        mtg-ssm is available on PyPI so, if you have python (>=3.3) and pip
        installed on your system, you should be able to get mtg-ssm by entering
        the following into a terminal:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip3 install mtg_ssm
        
        Updates can be performed by entering:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip3 install -U mtg_ssm
        
        You can verify installation from the terminal by running:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm --help
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        For first time use, you will want to create an empty spreadsheet with
        card data:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm create collection.xlsx
        
        In the future, when new sets are released, you will want to update your
        collection spreadsheet while keeping existing counts:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm update collection.xlsx
        
        Existing collections
        --------------------
        
        If you already have your cards in another collection store, you might
        want to import that collection into your card spreadsheet.
        
        First create an input csv file:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm create input_data.csv
        
        Then modify the template to match your counts and import into your
        spreadsheet:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm merge collection.xlsx input_data.csv
        
        Export / import to deckbox
        --------------------------
        
        If you already have your cards entered into `Deckbox`_, you can export a
        csv from deckbox and import the contents into a spreadsheet just as you might
        merge from an existing collection using the "deckbox" import format:
        
        .. _Deckbox: https://deckbox.org
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm --dialect csv deckbox merge collection.xlsx Inventory_username_2016.March.10.csv
        
        Alternatively, if you have your collection in a spreadsheet already and would
        like to load your data into deckbox to check prices or share with other people,
        just go the other direction.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            mtg-ssm --dialect csv deckbox merge inventory.csv collection.xlsx
        
        Deckbox Warning
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        MTG JSON, which we use for card data doesn't always map 1-to-1 to cards in
        Deckbox. This means that data can lose granularity in going from one form
        to the other, or back. If you intend to use both native mtg-ssm spreadsheets
        and Deckbox, I encourage you to choose one to be authoritative and always
        export to the other; going back and forth is probably not a good idea.
        
        The following conversion issues are known to exist:
        
        -   Sets that contain multiple versions of the same card (ex. Thallid in Fallen
            Empires) may lose track of the specific version when going back and forth.
        -   Alternate art cards (ex. Ertai, the Corrupted in Planeshift) may lose track
            of the art version when going back and forth.
        -   Not all Clash Pack cards are available in mtg-ssm.

        -   `Wizards of the Coast`_: For making Magic: the Gathering and continuing
            to support it. Off and on, it's been my favorite hobby since the
            early '90s.
        -   `MTG JSON`_: MTG JSON is an amazing resource for anyone looking to build
            tools around magic card data. It is pretty much **THE** source for
            structured magic card data. Without MTG JSON this project would not have
            been possible.
