Description
-----------

m - minimalistic media manager

m keeps track of which files you've played (or are still playing) and
thus allows you to easily continue playing the next file (using vlc).

-  Supports importing existing playing/watched data from Kodi.
-  Stores its data in JSON files (one per directory) in ``~/.obfusk-m``;
   you can put this directory in git if you want a changelog :)

NB: extracting the timestamp from the vlc config is a little hacky :(

NB: m uses ``$PWD`` to make sure it sees the current path the same as
the shell it is run from (i.e. it does not resolve the path by following
symlinks, allowing the link targets to be relocated); unfortunately,
this means that it *does not* see two directories as identical if they
are accessed using different paths, even if the resolved path is the
same. So you may want to avoid using different paths to the same
directory (and ``--dir``).

Examples
--------

.. code:: bash

    $ cd /some/media/dir
    $ m ls    # list files ([*] = skip, [x] = done, [>] = playing, [ ] = new)
    [x] Something - 01.mkv
    [x] Something - 02.mkv
    [x] Something - 03.mkv
    [x] Something - 04.mkv
    [x] Something - 05.mkv
    [x] Something - 06.mkv
    [>] Something - 07.mkv 0:04:04
    [ ] Something - 08.mkv
    [ ] Something - 09.mkv
    $ m next  # plays current/next episode (i.e. #7) w/ vlc

.. code:: bash

    $ m ld    # list dirs (shows #playing, #new for indexed subdirectories)
    (   2!) Dir A
    (     ) Dir B
    (1> 0!) Dir C
    (   0!) Dir D

Commands include: ``list``/``ls``, ``list-dirs``/``ld``,
``list-all``/``la``, ``next``, ``play FILE``, ``mark FILE``,
``unmark FILE``, ``skip FILE``, ``index``, ``playing``, ``watched``,
``skipped``.

See also the tests in the source code for more examples.

Installing
----------

You can just put ``m.py`` somewhere on your ``$PATH`` (in e.g.
``~/bin``; I suggest calling it ``m``, but you're free to choose another
name).

Alternatively, you can use pip:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip3 install --user mmm   # for Debian; on other OS's you may need
                                # pip instead of pip3 and/or no --user

TODO
----

-  ``ack TODO``
-  only use ``safe()`` when stdout is a tty?
-  bash completion?
-  more file extensions!
-  ``--tree`` for ``playing`` etc.?
-  kodi db export/sync?
-  sign pypi package?
