TL;DR
-----

::

    $ pip install dotapatch

Save a changelog file in accordance with the following format:

::

    6.88f:
    --
    * Purifying Flames manacost increased from 50/60/70/80 to 80/85/90/95
    * Morphling base damage reduced by 4
    * Nyx's Scepter Burrow cast time increased from 1 to 1.5
    * Fixed Return working on Centaur Illusions

Head over to the directory you saved the changelog and run
**dotapatch**.

::

    $ cd Desktop/changelogs
    $ dotapatch 688f
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

Make sure that ``<filename>`` is in your current directory. You can also
provide the ``path`` to the changelog.

::

    $ dotapatch /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

Getting started
---------------

You will need python.

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python

How does it work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ dotapatch -h
    usage: dotapatch [-h] [-t TEMPLATE] [-V] [-d] [-s] [-q] file

    Parse Dota 2 text patches to html format.

    positional arguments:
      file                  changelog to be formated

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t TEMPLATE, --template TEMPLATE
                            base template to generate HTML
      -V, --version         show program's version number and exit

    logging arguments:
      -d, --debug           set verbosity level to DEBUG
      -s, --save-log        save log output
      -q, --quiet           less verbose

Run **dotapatch** stating the full path to the file:

::

    $ dotapatch /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

Or you can head over to the directory with the changelog and run
**dotapatch** stating only the filename:

::

    $ cd Desktop/changelogs
    $ dotapatch 688f
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

There are some optional arguments that you can use:

::

    $ dotapatch --version
    dotapatch: v2.0

    $ dotapatch 688f
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

    $ dotapatch 688f --quiet

    $ dotapatch 688f --debug
    DEBUG Reading changelog.
    DEBUG Parsing changelog.
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/Desktop/changelogs/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

    $ dotapatch dotapatch/changelogs/688f --save-log
    INFO Recording log file at /home/arthurazs/git/dotapatch/dotapatch.log
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/git/dotapatch/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

    $ dotapatch dotapatch/changelogs/688f --template gh-pages
    INFO Using 'gh-pages' template.
    INFO HTML saved at /home/arthurazs/git/dotapatch/688f.html
    INFO Conversion went smoothly.

-  ``--template`` indicates which template is going to be used to parse
   the changelog. The ``default`` template generates a standalone HTML
   that uses `dota2 <http://dota2.com>`__ css files.
-  ``--debug`` and ``--quiet`` increase and decrease **dotapatch**'s
   verbosity, respectively.
-  ``--save-log`` saves a log with maximum verbosity output.

Gathering a new changelog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to `dota2 news <https://www.dota2.com/news/updates/>`__ page and

   -  The content you save **must** start with the patch name followed
      by colon (e.g. ``6.88f:``).
   -  The second line won't be read, so you can leave it with anything
      other than a real changelog line (e.g. ``--``).
   -  **All** the following lines **must** start with a star/asterisk
      (e.g. ``* Anti-mage magic resistance reduced by a lot``).
