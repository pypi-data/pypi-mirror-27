Description: The Ammeon Workflow Engine (AWE) uses a workflow, a file containing a series of tasks that are grouped into categories (or phases), to define and execute the steps needed to perform operations on the servers in a deployment. AWE is designed to simplify the complex steps involved in managing a solution (for example, performing upgrades or other maintenance tasks) across multiple servers.
