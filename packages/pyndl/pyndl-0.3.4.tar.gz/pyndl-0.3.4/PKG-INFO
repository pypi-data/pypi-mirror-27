        This python3 package is a collection of useful script in order to run tasks on
        huge amounts of text file corpora. Especially, it allows to efficiently apply
        the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule to these corpora.
        
        .. warning::
        
            This package is still in alpha and there might be some API changes in the
            near future. If you have suggestings concerning the ``pyndl`` package,
            contact us under konstantin (dot) sering (ät) uni-tuebingen.de.
        
        .. note::
        
            This package is not intended to be used under python2.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        These instructions will get you a copy of the ``pyndl`` package on your local
        machine. If you only want to use ``pyndl`` as a python package use ``pip3`` in
        order to install it into your python3 environment. If you want to inspect and
        change the code download and install it via ``git clone`` and ``python3
        setup.py``. For details see below.
        
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        You need python 3.5 or newer and git installed on your machine. We recommend to
        install Minicoda (https://conda.io/miniconda.html) before installing ``pyndl``
        or to create a virtualenv within your personal folder.
        
        Development
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        If you want to develop ``pyndl`` you should additionally install:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip3 install --user tox pylint pytest pycodestyle sphinx
        
        
        Installing
        ----------
        If you only want to use the package run you can install ``pyndl`` from pypi with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip3 install --user pyndl
        
        If you want to inspect and change the source code as well as running tests and
        having local documentation, clone the repository and install the package in
        'development' mode by running
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/quantling/pyndl.git
            cd pyndl
            python3 setup.py develop --user
        
        
        Documentation and Examples
        --------------------------
        Documentation and examples can be found under
        http://pyndl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or in the ``doc/`` folder after cloning
        the repository.
        
        If you have installed ``sphinx`` you should be able to build the documentation with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           cd doc/
           make html
        
        The entry point for the html documentation is ``doc/build/html/index.html``.
        
        
        Running the tests
        =================
        If you have cloned ``pyndl`` from github, you can start the tests by executing
        the following within the outer ``pyndl`` folder:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            py.test
            py.test doc/source/examples.rst
        
        
        For full tests you can run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            tox -e test
        
        For manually checking coding guidelines run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pycodestyle pyndl tests
            pylint --ignore-patterns='.*\.so' --rcfile=setup.cfg -j 2 pyndl tests
        
        For more details on which tests run in the continuous testing environment
        look at the file ``tox.ini``.
        
        
        Deployment
        ==========
        In order to create a source dist package run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python3 setup.py sdist

        Versioning
        ==========
        At the moment we are still in alpha and therefore no stable API is guaranteed
        between minor version increments, but soon we will change to use `SemVer
        <http://semver.org/>`_ for versioning. For the versions available, see the
        `tags on this repository <https://github.com/quantling/pyndl/tags>`_.

        Acknowledgments
        ===============
        This package is build as a python replacement for the R ndl2 package. Some
        ideas on how to build the API and how to efficiently run the Rescorla Wagner
        iterative learning on large text corpora are inspired by the way the ndl2
        package solves this problems. The ndl2 package will be published to github in
        August 2017 and a reference will be placed here.
