# Le Poop ðŸ’©
An undo for your pip commands. Why use `Le Poop` instead of `uninstall`? Take any `install`. It can come with a slew of dependencies, and `pip uninstall` graciously allows you to remove your new package, and all its friends, one by one. `Le Poop` cleans up *all* the mess with a single command, `poop`. To get started, install using pip.

```
pip install lepoop
```

Then, run `poop` after any `pip` command you regret.

`Le Poop` supports undos for the only three `pip` commands it makes sense to undo:

- `pip install`: Uninstall packages that were *just* installed. Leaves older packages intact, unless `poop` is run successively.
- `pip download`: Removes tarballs and wheels for the just-downloaded package and all its dependencies.
- `pip uninstall`: Reinstall the package in question.

```
usage: poop [-h] [-a] [--harder] [--stronger] [--skip SKIP]
            [package [package ...]]

positional arguments:
  package      packages to uninstall

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -a, --alias  Alias to `poop`
  --harder     Look through bash history as far as possible.
  --stronger   Look through bash history and module source files for modules
               to uninstall.
  --skip SKIP  Number of pip commands to skip.
```

### Inspiration (Rated R) ðŸ¤­

Inspired by [nvbn](http://github.com/nvbn/)'s [The Fuck](http://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) (no affiliation). I initially wanted to name this repository `The Shit`. The command-line utility would be `shit`, and if the app had no suggestions, it'd respond `no shit`. Ultimately decided to keep it PG. `Poop` is closer to `pip` in edit distance any how.
