# engine
#
# // overview
# Network engine. This is the core class of the eng system. It provides
# something that's similar to a reactor, but it's less ambitious than other
# reactor-based systems.
#
# Maybe you're here because you're trying to understand how to use this class.
# This would be a hairy read. A better starting point would be scenarios.py.
#   * See if the thing you are trying to do is covered there. If it is, then
#     learn by example, and spare yourself the anguish of reading this system.
#   * Also, there's a FAQ at the top there.
#
# If you do decide to press on and delve into this code, I recommend you start
# as follows:
#   - read the header for metasock.py. There's lots of edge-cases in the
#   Berkeley sockets API, and there's an unusual amount of complexity to
#   facading that. Much of what is here is explained by that priority.
#   - read from event_loop below to see what an engine instance does once
#   it has been started.

    This exists to handle a very specific scenario. Imagine if you decide to
    close a socket during an event loop. The event loop has several stages.
    You don't want the later stages of the event loop to do things to the
    socket if it is in closing.

    This callback exists so that we can have an ignore list for things that
    are in that state.
    
    Unlike other callbacks in the file, user code should never be concerned
    with it. It is specific to the relationship between Engine and Metasock.

    You don't need to be aware of this structure you're coming to grips
    with engine/metasock. It has been deliberately kept out of cs.py to
    reduce the likelihood of end-users being confused by it.
