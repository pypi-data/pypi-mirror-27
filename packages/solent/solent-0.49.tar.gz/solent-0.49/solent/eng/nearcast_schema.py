# nearcast schema
#
# // overview
# Each orb has a nearcast. The definition for the message structures that
# can be send over that nearcast are stored in an instance of the class
# described here.
#
# Nearcast schemas are defined in a dialect of interface script. There is
# an example below, and a few examples in scenarios.py

    Captures the message schema of a nearcast group.

    This is basically a wrapper for an ordered dictionary. It contains
    messages. The reason I've done it up as its own class is to present
    an more obvious interface to anyone who is interacting with this
    code.

    Note that a nearcast schema is quite a bit simpler than the schema you'd
    use for a broadcast, or for a bespoke protocol. The reason for this: we
    don't need to serialise the message, meaning there is a bunch of type
    information that we can dispense with.

        This attaches a variable called nearcast to a cog so that cog code can
        nearcast just by saying "self.nearcast.message_h(args)". This is a lot
        less hassle than typing "self.orb.nearcast", and then having to supply
        the cog itself, the message_h, and then the arguments.

        Essentially, this gives the semantics of python functions to nearcast
        messages. Which is pretty damn cool.

        The mechanism here is ugly. Unimportant. When we move to a typed
        language, there's several ways we could handle this: inheritance, use
        of macros.
