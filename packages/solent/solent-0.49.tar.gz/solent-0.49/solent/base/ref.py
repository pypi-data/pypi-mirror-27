# refstore
#
# // overview
# This class won't exist in a future C-style implementation. It's necessary
# in python so that we can pass references around in such a way that they
# do not live in memory forever. We have this refstore, which maintains
# aquire/release counts over references. Then the python implementations of
# mempool/sip touch the refstore.
#
# The acquire/release model here is not quite the same as in objective-c.
# When you create a reference, it starts at 0. But it doesn't get cleaned up.
# It gets cleaned up when a release is done on it that takes it to 0.
#
# Remember: this is a sequencer architecture design that happens to currently
# be written in python. It's only a matter of time until we port it to
# something low-garbage, and to leave the door open to that there are places
# where we need to be in control of our memory.
