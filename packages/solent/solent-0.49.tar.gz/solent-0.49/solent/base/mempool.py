# mempool
#
# // overview
# Allows us to get and retrieve mutable byte arrays.
#
# Remember: this is a sequencer architecture design that happens to currently
# be written in python. It's only a matter of time until we port it to
# something low-garbage, and to leave the door open to that there are places
# where we need to be in control of our memory. If it makes it easier, try to
# think of this as a C codebase that happens to currently be implemented in
# python.
