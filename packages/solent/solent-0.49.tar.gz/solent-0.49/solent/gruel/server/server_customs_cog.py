# // further work
# The logic around max_fulldoc_size is not implemented.
#
# // overview
# This is the main workhorse and clearing-yard for the server side of the
# gruel protocol. All intent to send a gruel must pass through this. All
# incoming gruel must pass through this. This class ensures that only
# authorised activity gets into the system, and it's responsible for
# splitting outgoing documents into sensible parcels.
#
# If we didn't have this class, we'd have to mix up all this business logic
# with the TCP server.
#
# The reason for the name 'customs' is in the spirit of national border
# enforcement. We don't trust anything that's coming in until we checked it
# through customs. (And thereby prevent unauthorised packets from being
# processed)
