AFQ-browser is a software library for visualization of results from
automated fiber quantification of human brain tractography.

The software takes as input the results of analysis from the ``AFQ`` software
and produces a browser-based visualization of the data. Command-line tools
allow users to create these visualizations from their data and upload them to
share with others as a website.
