Description: # Introduction
        
        **hgf** is a hierarchical GUI framework for Python, built on top of Pygame. It is designed to ease the creation of graphical applications that,
        
        - **Support external configuration** - controls, options, style
        - **Manage structural complexity** - by composing simple elements
        - **Separate major concerns** - behavior, layout, appearance
        
        With code that is easy to read, write, and extend, with minimal boilerplate.
        
        hgf is currently version 0.2.0, pre-alpha. The API may be volatile, but any changes to it will be made in an effort to better manifest these design principles.
