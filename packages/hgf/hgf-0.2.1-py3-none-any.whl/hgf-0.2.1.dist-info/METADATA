# Introduction

**hgf** is a hierarchical GUI framework for Python, built on top of Pygame. It is designed to ease the creation of graphical applications that,

- **Support external configuration** - controls, options, style
- **Manage structural complexity** - by composing simple elements
- **Separate major concerns** - behavior, layout, appearance

With code that is easy to read, write, and extend, with minimal boilerplate.

hgf is currently version 0.2.1, pre-alpha. The API may be volatile, but any changes to it will be made in an effort to better manifest these design principles.
