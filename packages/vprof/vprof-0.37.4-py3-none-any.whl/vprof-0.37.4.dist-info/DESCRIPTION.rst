vprof
=====

vprof is a Python package providing rich and interactive visualizations for
various Python program characteristics such as running time and memory usage.
It supports Python 2.7, Python 3.4+ and distributed under BSD license.

The project is in active development and some of its features might not work as
expected.

Contributing
------------
All contributions are highly encouraged! You can add new features,
report and fix existing bugs and write docs and tutorials.
Feel free to open an issue or send a pull request!

Prerequisites
-------------
Dependencies to build ``vprof`` from source code:

 * Python 2.7 or Python 3.4+
 * ``pip``
 * ``npm`` >= 3.3.12

``npm`` is required to build ``vprof`` from sources only.

Dependencies
------------
All Python and ``npm`` module dependencies are listed in ``package.json`` and
``requirements.txt``.

Installation
------------
``vprof`` can be installed from PyPI

.. code-block ::

    pip install vprof


To build ``vprof`` from sources, clone this repository and execute

.. code-block ::

    python setup.py deps_install && python setup.py build_ui && python setup.py install


To install just ``vprof`` dependencies, run

.. code-block ::

    python setup.py deps_install


Usage
-----

.. code-block ::

    vprof -c <config> <src>

``<config>`` is a combination of supported modes:

* ``c`` - CPU flame graph

Shows CPU flame graph for ``<src>``.

* ``p`` - profiler

Runs built-in Python profiler on ``<src>`` and displays results.

* ``m`` - memory graph

Shows objects that are tracked by CPython GC and left in memory after code
execution. Also shows process memory usage after execution of each line of ``<src>``.

* ``h`` - code heatmap

Displays all executed code of ``<src>`` with line run times and execution counts.

``<src>`` can be Python source file (e.g. ``testscript.py``) or path to package
(e.g. ``myproject/test_package``).

To run scripts with arguments use double quotes

.. code-block ::

    vprof -c cmh "testscript.py --foo --bar"


Modes can be combined

.. code-block ::

    vprof -c cm testscript.py


``vprof`` can also profile functions. In order to do this,
launch ``vprof`` in remote mode:

.. code-block ::

    vprof -r


``vprof`` will open new tab in default web browser and then wait for stats.

To profile a function run

.. code-block:: python

    from vprof import runner

    def foo(arg1, arg2):
        ...

    runner.run(foo, 'cmhp', args=(arg1, arg2), host='localhost', port=8000)


where ``cmhp`` is profiling mode, ``host`` and ``port`` are hostname and port of
``vprof`` server launched in remote mode. Obtained stats will be rendered in new
tab of default web browser, opened by ``vprof -r`` command.

``vprof`` can save profile stats to file and render visualizations from
previously saved file.

.. code-block ::

    vprof -c cmh src.py --output-file profile.json


writes profile to file and

.. code-block ::

    vprof --input-file profile.json

renders visualizations from previously saved file.

Check ``vprof -h`` for full list of supported parameters.

To show UI help, press ``h`` when visualizations are displayed.

Also you can check ``examples`` directory for more profiling examples.

Testing
-------

.. code-block ::

    python setup.py test && python setup.py e2e_test
