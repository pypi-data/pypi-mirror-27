Introduction
============
This package provides python bindings for the `lz4 compression library
<https://cyan4973.github.io/lz4//>`_ by Yann Collet.

At this time the project contains bindings for the LZ4 block format, which are
considered stable.

Support for the LZ4 frame format is a work-in-progress and available as a
technology preview. A future relase will implement support for the LZ4 stream
format.
