This project contains several transformations used for signal processing,
along with associated tools.

**Transformations**

As of v0.2, the included transformations are: discrete Fourier transform (dft),
discrete cosine transform (dct), and discrete wavelet transform (dwt).

**GPU-Acceleration**

Each of these transformations has both a sequential and a GPU-acclerated
version. To use the GPU-accelerated version, you would simply import
"[transformation_name]Cuda" instead of 'transformation_name".  For example,
you might use

import pygasp.dwtCuda as dwt

instead of using

import pygasp.dwt as dwt

to get the CUDA version of the dwt.  

*NOTE*: To use the CUDA versions, you must have a CUDA-capable GPU and have
installed the PyCUDA library. Information on this library can be found
at: mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda .

**Tools**

As of v0.2, the tools include:
	* high-, low-, and bandpass filters for the fft
	* hard and soft thresholding for the dwt
	* scalogram visualization of the dwt

**License**

This library is free and open-source software released under the MIT License.
