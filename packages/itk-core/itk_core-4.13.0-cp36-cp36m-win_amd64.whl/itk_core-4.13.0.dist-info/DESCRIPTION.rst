ITK is an open-source, cross-platform library that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis. Developed through extreme programming methodologies, ITK employs leading-edge algorithms for registering and segmenting multidimensional scientific images.

This package contain the toolkit framework used by other modules. There are common base classes for data objects and process objects, basic data structures such as Image, Mesh, QuadEdgeMesh, and SpatialObjects, and common functionality for operations such as finite differences, image adaptors, or image transforms.
