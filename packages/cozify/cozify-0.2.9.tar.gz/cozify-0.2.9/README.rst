python-cozify
=============

Unofficial Python3 API bindings for the (unpublished) Cozify API.
Includes 1:1 API calls plus helper functions to string together an
authentication flow.

Installation
------------

The recommended way is to install from PyPi:

.. code:: bash

       sudo -H pip3 install cozify

or clone the master branch of this repo (master stays at current release) and:

.. code:: bash

       sudo python3 setup.py install

To develop python-cozify clone the devel branch and submit pull requests against the devel branch.
New releases are cut from the devel branch as needed.

Basic usage
-----------
These are merely some simple examples, for the full documentation see: `http://python-cozify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`

read devices, extract multisensor data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from cozify import hub, multisensor
    devices = hub.getDevices()
    print(multisensor.getMultisensorData(devices))

only authenticate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from cozify import cloud
    cloud.authenticate()
    # authenticate() is interactive and usually triggered automatically
    # authentication data is stored in ~/.config/python-cozify/python-cozify.cfg

authenticate with a non-default state storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from cozify import cloud, config
    config.setStatePath('/tmp/testing-state.cfg')
    cloud.authenticate()
    # authentication and other useful data is now stored in the defined location instead of ~/.config/python-cozify/python-cozify.cfg
    # you could also use the environment variable XDG_CONFIG_HOME to override where config files are stored

Keeping authentication valid
----------------------------
If the cloud token expires, the only option to get a new one is an interactive prompt for an OTP.
Since most applications will want to avoid that as much as possible there are a few tips to keep a valid token alive.
At the time of writing tokens are valid for 28 days during which they can be seamlessly refreshed.

In most cases it isn't necessary to directly call cloud.refresh() if you're already using cloud.ping() to test token validity.
cloud.ping() will also perform a refresh check after a successful ping unless explicitly told not to do so.

To refresh a token you can call as often as you want:

.. code:: python

    cloud.refresh()

By default keys older than a day will be re-requested and otherwise no refresh is performed. The refresh can be forced:

.. code:: python

    cloud.refresh(force=True)

And the expiry duration can be altered (also when calling cloud.ping()):

.. code:: python

    cloud.refresh(expiry=datetime.timedelta(days=20))
    # or
    cloud.ping(autorefresh=True, expiry=datetime.timedelta(days=20))

Tests
-----
pytest is used for unit tests. Test coverage is still quite spotty and under active development.

During development you can run the test suite right from the source directory:

.. code:: bash

    pytest -v

To run the test suite on an already installed python-cozify:

.. code:: bash

    pytest -v --pyargs cozify

Current limitations
-------------------

-  Token functionality is sanity-checked up to a point and renewal is
   attempted. This however is new code and may not be perfect.
-  For now there are only read calls. New API call requests are welcome
   as issues or pull requests!
-  authentication flow is as automatic as possible but if the Cozify
   Cloud token expires we can't help but request it and ask it to be
   entered. If you are running a daemon that requires authentication and
   your cloud token expires, run just the authenticate() flow in an
   interactive terminal and then restart your daemon.
