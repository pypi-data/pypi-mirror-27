[osrframework_server]

# Host of the server. It can be localhost or things like 0.0.0.0 (which would
#   make it accesible from everywhere):
host = localhost
#host = 0.0.0.0
# The port to be used:
port = 30230
# Whether to use it in debug mode. False is 0 and True is 1.
debug = 0
# This string should be something random to control who can configure the
#   searches. If this string is intercepted, anyone would be able to configure
#   OSRFramework using a specially crafted URL to do what they want, not what
#   the admin wanted. If None is provided, advanced searches will be blocked.
