1 - Description
---------------

This package will fix the dependencies to make OSRFramework work as an HTTP
server. The functionalities included in this package were initially included
in the core of OSRFramework. For escalability, since version 0.18.0 of
OSRFramework this package has been moved to a separate project.

This package will automatically build and prepare the tools needed to make this
possible. For more information about OSRFramework check the main project:
