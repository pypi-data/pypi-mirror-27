The goal of this project is to be an alternative to using [kivy](https://kivy.org/) for building mobile apps with python. 

I made this because wanted to have a more "React Native" like environment that: 
1. Uses python 
2. Uses native widgets (Android / iOS)
3. Can be run from Android Studio / XCode (ie no bootstraps)
4. Uses enaml's models, and declarative and dynamic widget framework instead of kvlang
5. Versioned "packages" and "recipes" than can be installed/updated/removed to make repeatable builds

> Android apps are currently working and have a lot of components. 
iOS is currently broken, and is limited to only a few components at the moment

### Docs and Examples ###

### Add-on Packages ###

Enaml-native was redesigned so separate "packages" can be created and installed to add new 
native widgets and other apis. Similar to the [kivy-garden](https://github.com/kivy-garden/) but
it borrows the concepts of the [react-native package manager](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm).

Packages can be created using the `enaml-native init-package <your-package-name>` command. Once
made they can be installed with `pip` or the `enaml-native install` command (recommended).

#### Packages ####

- GoogleMap support via [enaml-native-maps](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native-maps)
- MPAndroidChart graphing via [enaml-native-charts](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native-charts)
- ZXing barcode scanning via [enaml-native-barcode](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native-barcode)
- Iconfiy icons via [enaml-native-icons](https://github.com/codelv/enaml-native-icons)
