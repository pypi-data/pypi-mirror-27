    Determines which backups to keep on the basis of a number of
    treshold moments in time. For each treshold, the most recent backup
    will be kept that:

    1.  is at least as old as the treshold; and
    2.  was not already selected on the basis of a younger treshold.

    Note that if there is a time period at which less backups were made
    than the scheme allows this function to keep, condition (2) allows
    the function to keep more older backups instead.

    :param ages: Integer values representing backups by their age. The
        value for the most recent backup should be 0. It is up to the
        caller to decide what the unit of time should be.

    :param tresholds: Age treshold values. The function behaves a bit
        differently depending on the type of argument passed:

        -   If it is :class:`Sized <collections.abc.Sized>`, then its
            length determines the maximum amount of backups to be kept.
            The tresholds will be sorted before they are used in the
            algorithm, so the iterable may be a set or a sequence in
            any random ordering. One treshold should be zero.

        -   If it is an iterator, then it must yield the age tresholds
            from lower (more recent) to higher (older), because they
            will be consumed on the fly as the algorithm walks through
            the backups. This allows the use of an infinite iterator, in
            which case the maximum amount of backups becomes a function
            of the age of the oldest backup in the set. The first
            treshold should be zero.

        -   If it is `None` or left out, then a generator will be
