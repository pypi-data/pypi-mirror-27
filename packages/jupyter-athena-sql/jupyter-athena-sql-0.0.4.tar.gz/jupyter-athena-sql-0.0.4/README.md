# We run SQL queries on AWS Athena from jupyter notebooks

![athena.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finklabs/jupyter-athena-sql/develop/docs/images/jupyter-in-action.png)


# run the notebook
I like using jupyterlab but other notebooks should work, too

``` bash
$ jupyter lab
```
this should open the notebook in your browser. just click on `athena.ipynb`.
