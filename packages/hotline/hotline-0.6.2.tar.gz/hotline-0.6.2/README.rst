Hotline
=======
Hotline is a pop-up input field written in Python with PyQt/PySide modeled after the command palette from Sublime Text. The API can be used to extend and customize Hotline by using the Context, Mode, and Command objects.

Using Hotline
=============
::

    from hotline import Hotline
    hl = Hotline()
    hl.show()

Hotline will attempt to use the best available context. You can also specify one.
::

    from hotline import Hotline, MayaContext
    hl = Hotline(MayaContext)
    hl.show()


Hotline in Autodesk Maya
========================

To allow for maximum flexibility hotline doesn't do anything sneaky like use singletons or a cache to maintain instances for you. In Maya this means you'll need to keep track of an instance of the Hotline ui. Here's how I'm doing that currently::

    from hotline import Hotline
    import __main__

    if not hasattr(__main__, 'hl'):
        __main__.hl = Hotline()

    __main__.hl.show()

Create a new runtime command with the above code and bind a hotkey to it.


Install Hotline
===============
::

    pip install hotline


To Do List
==========

 - Adjust Context API to make it easier to extend existing contexts
 - Add additional dialogs to make multi-stage commands more rich
 - Create settings dialog that can be used to adjust context settings
 - Persist history and settings

completed
=========

 - **Implement input history**
