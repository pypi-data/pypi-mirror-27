        Extension to setuptools to run your package through nuitka to produce compiled, faster, obfuscated binary modules.
        
        Nuitka [http://nuitka.net/pages/overview.html] is a python compiler with full language support and CPython compatibility.
        
            It's fully compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
        
            You feed it your Python app, it does a lot of clever things, and spits out an executable or extension module.
        
        This module provides some hooks to add to your python packages setup.py to automatically run some/all of your code
        through nuitka when building a binary dist. This will typically be done with `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to
        create a wheel for distribution.
        
        With nuitka-setuptools this wheel can be devoid of pure python and only contain compiled code which is not only faster
        (quote: Nuitka is more than 2 times faster than CPython) but has a relatively high level of code security.
        
        Basic Usage: setup.py::
        
            import sys
            from setuptools import setup
        
            # Get the long description from the README file
            with open(path.join(path.dirname(__file__), 'README.rst'), 'r') as f:
                long_description = f.read()
        
            packages = ['mod', 'pkg']
        
            if any('bdist' in arg for arg in sys.argv):
                from nuitka_setuptools import Nuitka, Compile
        
                build_settings = dict(
                    # Compile module
                    cmdclass={'build_ext': Nuitka},
                    ext_modules=Compile(packages),
                )
            else:
                build_settings = {}
        
        
            setup(
                name='nuitka_setuptools',
                py_modules=['nuitka_setuptools'],
                description='Extension to setuptools to run your package through nuitka to '
                            'produce compiled, faster, obfuscated binary modules.',
