========================
Django Analytics Tracker
========================

Django Analytics is a web analytics service for Django web applications. It focuses on tracking registered users, 
and provides detailed information and insights about them and how they use your site.

It does so using a hybrid client-side / server-side solution which ensures that every request is trackable. 
The Django Analytics middleware plugs straight into Django's ``User`` model, collecting all the information it needs. 
Then, this information is inserted into the HTML response as a single asynchronous client request. 
In case the response is not an HTML document, the tracking data is sent directly from the server.

The ``da_tracker`` package contains the middleware class which needs to be included in your Django web application.
