A TLA+ specification and proofs of relevant properties for
an algorithm that computes the cyclic core of a minimal
covering problem. This algorithm was originally proposed
in the context of two-level logic minimization.

The modules:

FiniteSetTheorems,
Functions,
FunctionTheorems,
NaturalsInduction,
