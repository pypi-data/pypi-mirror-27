Synopsis
========

This repository contains popular Machine Learning algorithms, which have
been introduced in various blog posts (http://ataspinar.com). Most of
the algorithms are accompanied with blog-posts in which I try to explain
the mathematics behind and the interpretation of these algorithms.

Motivation
==========

Machine Learning is fun! But more importantly, Machine Learning is easy.
But the academic literature or even (wikipedia-pages) is full with
unnecessary complicated terminology, notation and formulae. This gives
people the idea that these ML algorithms can only be understood with a
full understanding of advanced math and statistics. Stripped from all of
these superfluous language we are left with simple maths which can be
expressed in a few lines of code.

Notebooks explaining the mathematics
====================================

I have also provided some notebooks, explaining the mathematics of some
Machine Learning algorithms. + `Linear Regression and Logistic
Regression <https://github.com/taspinar/siml/blob/master/notebooks/Linear%20Regression%2C%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb>`__
+ `Naive Bayes

+ `Perceptron

Installation
============

To install **siML**:

.. code:: python

    (sudo) pip install siml

or you can clone the repository and in the folder containing setup.py

.. code:: python

    python setup.py install
