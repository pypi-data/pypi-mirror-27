"""
The local queue transport roughly mimics a normal TCP transport, but it sends
and receives messages via two :class:`asyncio.Queue` instances.

Its purpose is to aid the development and debugging of complex networking
algorithms and distributed or multi-agent systems.  In contrast to normal
network transports, messages send via the :class:`LocalQueueTransport` will
always arrive in a deterministic order [#]_.

This transport does *not* work across multiple processes and is *not* thread
safe, so it should only be used within a single thread and process.

The easiest way to use it is to create a :class:`LocalQueue` instance via the
:func:`get_queue()` function and pass it to
:func:`aiomas.channel.start_server()`/:func:`aiomas.channel.open_connection()`
or :meth:`aiomas.agent.Container.create()` as *addr* argument.

.. [#] Actually, message sent via a single TCP connection also arrive at a
       deterministic order (this is a property of the TCP/IP protocol).  So
       the LocalQueue transport won't give you any benefits in this case.

       However, if you have multiple connections to the same server and send
       message through them in parallel, it's no longer deterministic in which
       order the messages arrive from the different connections.  In this case,
       the LocalQueue transport can help you.
