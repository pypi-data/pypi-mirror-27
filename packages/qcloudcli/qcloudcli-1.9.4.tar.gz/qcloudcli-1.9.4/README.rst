=======================================
The Qcloud CLI (Command Line Interface)
=======================================

The Qcloud CLI is an open source tool built on top of the Qcloud API that provides commands for interacting with Qcloud services.

The CLI works on Python versions:

   * 2.6.5 and greater, including 3.x.x

Quick Start
-----------
First, install the library:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install qcloudcli

or download source code from github and install:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/QcloudApi/qcloudcli.git
    $ cd qcloudcli
    $ python setup.py install

Command Completion
------------------
On Unix-like systems, the qcloudcli includes a command-completion feature that enables you to use the TAB key to complete a partially typed command. This feature is not automatically installed, so you need to configure it manually.
