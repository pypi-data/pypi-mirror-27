= Getting Started =

This document describes getting a server and clients up and running for the first time. You have two options: 

 1. Run the link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/docker.adoc[docker image]. This is the fastest way to get a basic install up and running for testing. Takes ~2 mins to download the image and initialize the server.
 2. Follow these instructions for an automated install on an Ubuntu system. This is a better option for stability and customization. Takes ~20 mins to download and install dependencies, you are prompted for some important settings.
 
If you're experienced with GRR and want to set up a server for development take a look at the link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/installfrompip.adoc[pip install instructions].

== Requirements ==

 * A linux box with Ubuntu Xenial Server 64-bit. See link:faq.adoc#what-operating-system-versions-does-the-server-support[here] for more details on operating system support.
 * Recommend > 1GB Ram and a modern CPU if you want to run everything on one box (note that free Amazon EC2 instances don't have enough RAM).
 * Some machines (or VMs) to talk to the server. OSX, Windows and Linux agents are supported. Client and server can run on the same host for testing purposes.

== Install the Server ==

Make sure the link:https://github.com/google/grr/blob/master/debian/control[pre-requisites]
for the server deb are installed: `apt install -y debhelper dpkg-dev python-dev python-pip rpm zip`

Find the latest stable release on link:https://github.com/google/grr/releases[github], then
download and install it, e.g:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.grr-response.com/grr-server_3.2.0-1_amd64.deb

dpkg -i grr-server_3.2.0-1_amd64.deb
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once this completes successfully you should have a working server with an admin interface on port 8000, open it in your browser. You should also have grr_console in your path to interact via console.

== Install the Clients ==

The pre-packaged clients should be visible in the web UI under Manage Binaries -> executables -> Windows -> installers. Download the client you need.

Run the client on the target machine as administrator:

 - For Windows you will see a 32 and 64 bit installer. Run the installer as admin 
   (it should load the UAC prompt if you are not admin). It should run silently 
   and install the client to `c:\windows\system32\grr\%version%\`. It will also install 
   a Windows Service, start it, and configure the registry keys to make it talk to the 
   URL/server you specified during repack of the clients on the server.
 - For OSX you will see a pkg file, install the pkg. It will add a launchd item and start it.
 - For Linux you will see a deb and rpms, install the appropriate one. For testing purposes you can run the client
   on the same machine as the server if you like.

After install, hit Enter in the search box in the top left corner of the UI to see all of your clients that have enrolled with the server. If you don't see clients, follow the link:https://github.com/google/grr-doc/blob/master/troubleshooting.adoc#i-dont-see-my-clients[troubleshooting steps].
