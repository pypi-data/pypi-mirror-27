= Setting Up For Linux RPM Signing =

Linux RPMs are signed following a similar process to windows. A template is
built inside the vagrant VM and the host does the repacking and signing.

To get set up for signing, first you need to create a gpg key that you will use
for signing (link:https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/[here's
a decent HOWTO]).

Then make sure you have rpmsign and rpm utilities installed on your host system:

----
sudo apt-get install rpm
----

Tell GRR where your public key is:

----
sudo ln -s /path/to/mykey.pub /etc/alternatives/grr_rpm_signing_key
----

Set this config variable to whatever you used as your key name:

----
ClientBuilder.rpm_gpg_name: my key name
----

That's it, you can follow the normal build process.
