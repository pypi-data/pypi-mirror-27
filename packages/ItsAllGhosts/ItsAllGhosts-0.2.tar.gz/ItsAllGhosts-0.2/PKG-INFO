Description: It's All Ghosts
        ===============
        
        What this is
        ------------
        
        It's All Ghosts is a universal "editor extension" for the GhostText_ browser
        add-on.
        
        While `It's All Text`_ was able to spawn almost any editor, GhostText focuses
        on such editors that are able to run plugin code on their own. This leaves
        users of most simple editors, like joe_, jupp_, nano_, gedit_ or kwrite_ behind.
        
        Compared to fully supported editors, there is a small trade-off: GhostText
        can update the text live between the input field and the editor.  This is
        not possible with It's All Ghosts.  Instead, It's All Ghosts simply spawns
        the editor on connect and passes the file contents back on exit.  It does,
        however, update the temporary file upon a change notification from the
        browser and some editors track file modifications - don't use that, however,
        because it will almost certainly destroy your contents somewhere.
        
        But apart from that, you can now again use your favourite editor again!
        
        How to define your editor
        -------------------------
        
        It's All Ghosts defaults to running nano in an xterm.
        
        You can place your own script to execute as editor into
        ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/itsallghosts_cmd``. Example::
        
            exec konsole --separate -e jstar $*
        
        This example runs jstar (from the joe_ suite) in KDE's Konsole instead.
        
        How to run
        ----------
        
        Just make sure that ``itsallghosts`` is running in your desktop session.
        
        Multi-user mod
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The architecture of the GostText protocoll does not allow running on a
        multi-user system, as it relies on port 4001 being available to exactly one
        user.
        
        It's All Ghosts can be run as a system service, handing off single sessions
        to the corresponding user. This is done by introspecting the HTTP connection
        and is a bit of black magic not guaranteed to work correctly.
        
        To run the system service, simply run ``itsallghosts`` as root (this is the
        only way of getting hold of socket owners).
        
        In each user session then run::
        
            itsallghosts --user
