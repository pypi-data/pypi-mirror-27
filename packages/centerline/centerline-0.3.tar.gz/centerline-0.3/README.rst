Calculate the centerline of a polygon.
--------------------------------------

Roads, rivers and similar linear structures are often represented by
long and complex polygons. Since one of the most important attributes of
a linear structure is its length, extracting that attribute from a
polygon can prove to be more or less difficult.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the package from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install centerline

This package has several dependencies, including Numpy,
`Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`__ and
`GDAL/OGR <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/>`__.

If you are installing these packages in the virtual environement,
make sure you have all the necessary dependencies on your system.
Furthermore, after installing GDAL locate the GDAL headers:

.. code:: bash

    $ whereis gdal
    gdal: /usr/include/gdal /usr/share/gdal

and set the include path using the following environment variables:

.. code:: bash

    $ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal/
    $ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal/

After that, you can proceed to installing GDAL in the virtual environment.

**It is important to note that the versions of GDAL installed globally and in
the virtual environment should match!**

Usage:
~~~~~~

If you plan on using this package inside of your own code, just type:

.. code:: python

    >>> from centerline import Centerline

However, if you just want to convert a Shapefile full of polygons into a
Shapefile full of centerlines, use the command line tool:

.. code:: bash

    $ create_centerlines INPUT_PATH.shp OUTPUT_PATH.shp [BORDER_DENSITY]

The BORDER\_DENSITY parameter is optional. If not specified, the default
value is 0.5.

The `create_centerlines` script is file format agnostic, meaning you should be able to work with all OGR's vector file formats. Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ create_centerlines input.shp output.geojson

References:
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `SciPy-Voronoi <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/spatial.html#voronoi-diagrams>`__

When defining the density factor, one has to take into
account the coordinate system defined in the Shapefile. The script was
designed to handle metric coordinate systems, so the density factor is
by default 0.5 (meters). For instance, if the value is set to 0.5 m, it
basically places additional points on the border at the distance of 0.5
m from each other. If the user doesn't define the value (see *Usage*),
the script uses the default value. If the value is a negative number, it
will be converted into a positive number.

It appears that the Voronoi function available in the *SciPy* module
does not handle large coordinates very well. Since most of the
coordinates are large numbers, a bounding box is needed to determine the
minimal X and Y coordinates, i.e. the bottom left corner of the bounding
box. These values are then used for coordinate reduction. Once the
Voronoi diagram is created the coordinates are returned to their
non-reduced form before creating LineStrings.
