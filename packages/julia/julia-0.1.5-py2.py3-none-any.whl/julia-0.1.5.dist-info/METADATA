|Build Status| |Build status|

Experimenting with developing a better interface to julia that works
with Python 2 & 3.

to run the tests, execute from the toplevel directory

.. code:: shell

    python -m unittest discover

**Note** You need to explicitly add julia to your ``PATH``, an alias
will not work.

``pyjulia`` is tested against Python versions 2.7 and 3.5. Older
versions of Python (than 2.7) are not supported.

Installation
------------

You will need to install PyCall in your existing Julia installation

.. code:: julia

    Pkg.add("PyCall")

Your python installation must be able to call Julia. If your installer
does not add the Julia binary directory to your ``PATH``, you will have
to add it.

Then finally you have to install pyjulia.

To get released versions you can use:

::

    pip install pyjulia

You may clone it directly to your home directory.

::

    git clone https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia

then inside the pyjulia directory you need to run the python setup file

::

    [sudo] pip install [-e] .

The ``-e`` flag makes a development install meaning that any change to
pyjulia source tree will take effect at next python interpreter restart
without having to reissue an install command.

``pyjulia`` is known to work with ``PyCall.jl`` ≥ ``v0.7.2``.

If you run into problems using ``pyjulia``, first check the version of
``PyCall.jl`` you have installed by running ``Pkg.installed("PyCall")``.

Usage
-----

To call Julia functions from python, first import the library

.. code:: python

    import julia

then create a Julia object that makes a bridge to the Julia interpreter
(assuming that ``julia`` is in your ``PATH``)

.. code:: python

    j = julia.Julia()

You can then call Julia functions from python, e.g.

.. code:: python

    j.sind(90)

How it works
------------

PyJulia loads the ``libjulia`` library and executes the statements
therein. To convert the variables, the ``PyCall`` package is used.
Python references to Julia objects are reference counted by Python, and
retained in the ``PyCall.pycall_gc`` mapping on the Julia side (the
mapping is removed when reference count drops to zero, so that the Julia
object may be freed).

Limitations
-----------

Not all valid Julia identifiers are valid Python identifiers. Unicode
identifiers are invalid in Python 2.7 and so ``pyjulia`` cannot call or
access Julia methods/variables with names that are not ASCII only.
Additionally, it is a common idiom in Julia to append a ``!`` character
to methods which mutate their arguments. These method names are invalid
Python identifers. ``pyjulia`` renames these methods by subsituting
``!`` with ``_b``. For example, the Julia method ``sum!`` can be called
in ``pyjulia`` using ``sum_b(...)``.
