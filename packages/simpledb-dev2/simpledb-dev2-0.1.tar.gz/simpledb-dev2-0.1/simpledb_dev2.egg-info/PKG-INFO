        This is a fork of
        `SimpleDB/dev <http://code.google.com/p/simpledb-dev/>`__ by Matthew
        Painter via `this unofficial
        mirror <https://github.com/latortuga/simpledb-dev>`__. This fork has
        been renamed to *simpledb-dev2* so that it does not collide with the
        original project.
        
        It currently supports the "2007-11-07" SimpleDB API level but has been
        hacked to fake support for "2009-04-15"—this has not been tested much!
        
        Project information
        -------------------
        
        simpledb-dev2 provides a local SimpleDB server, so you can develop
        offline, without requiring a SimpleDB account. It has been tested on
        Linux, macOS and Windows.
        
        This package currently implements:
        
        -  The whole "2007-11-07" REST API
        -  Correct HTTP error responses as per the technical documentation
        -  A large suite of tests created from the examples provided in the
           technical documentation
        
        It does not implement:
        
        -  The SOAP API
        -  Authentication—signature value checking
        -  Timestamp format and expiration checking
        -  HTTPS
        
        To run the simpledb-dev2 server, you'll need a working Python 2.7
        installation. You can install using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`__ as
        follows:
        
        ::
        
            pip install simpledb-dev2
        
        This will install the package and its dependencies including
        `web.py <http://webpy.org/>`__. Specify the ``--user`` option to the
        ``pip`` command line to install for the current user only.
        
        This will create a ``simpledb-dev2`` script/executable on your path. You
        can start the simpledb-dev2 web server as follows:
        
        ::
        
            simpledb-dev2 serve
        
        This will serve the SimpleDB API on the default port of 8080. To specify
        an alternative port, use the ``--port`` option:
        
        ::
        
            simpledb-dev2 serve --port 1234
        
        If the server doesn't start, or you have other problems, it's pretty
        easy to run the tests and see some examples of request/response:
        
        ::
        
            simpledb-dev2 test
        
        Remember, this is a development tool, and not meant for storing or
        querying large amounts of data—I do not know yet how big you can get
        before running into issues, but I suspect that with the current storage
        and querying design it is not that large :o) Now that I have a base, I
        may start trying to see how I can improve the performance…
        
        Although this conforms to the specifications in the technical
        documentation, simpledb-dev2 has not been tested with every possible SDB
        client library, and I am looking forward to people in the OSS community
        trying to find bugs and peculiarities—it is after all, a work in
        progress!
        
        *So enjoy developing your SimpleDB applications now, not later!*
