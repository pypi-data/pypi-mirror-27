Mock library to replace aioredis during unit tests
==================================================

| mockaioredis is to `aioredis <https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis>`__
  what the `mockredispy <https://github.com/locationlabs/mockredis>`__
  library is to plain
  `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`__.
| It uses the mockredispy library and wraps it in the asyncio magic
  required to work like
| aioredis.

Uses the new ``async`` keyword for Python 3.5, so no 3.4 support.

| **Beware**: This is an early alpha that isn't even close to
  API-complete.
| In fact, so far it only supports the limited set of calls I needed for
  another project.
| Eventually, as I use more and more aioredis calls in my other
  projects, this mock layer
| will be fleshed out more.

Installation
------------

| For now, I suggest cloning the git repository and ``pip install``\ ing
  from there.
| Eventually, as mockaioredis becomes more feature complete, I'll push
  it to PyPI as well.
