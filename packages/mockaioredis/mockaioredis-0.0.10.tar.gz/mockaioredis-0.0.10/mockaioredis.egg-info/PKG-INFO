Description: Mock library to replace aioredis during unit tests
        ==================================================
        
        | mockaioredis is to `aioredis <https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis>`__
          what the `mockredispy <https://github.com/locationlabs/mockredis>`__
          library is to plain
          `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`__.
        | It uses the mockredispy library and wraps it in the asyncio magic
          required to work like
        | aioredis.
        
        Uses the new ``async`` keyword for Python 3.5, so no 3.4 support.
        
        | **Beware**: This is an early alpha that isn't even close to
          API-complete.
        | In fact, so far it only supports the limited set of calls I needed for
          another project.
        | Eventually, as I use more and more aioredis calls in my other
          projects, this mock layer
        | will be fleshed out more.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        | For now, I suggest cloning the git repository and ``pip install``\ ing
          from there.
        | Eventually, as mockaioredis becomes more feature complete, I'll push
          it to PyPI as well.
