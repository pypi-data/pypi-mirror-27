        # uniphy
        Uniphy stands for "**Uni**versity **Phy**sics". The package focuses on specialised functionality for research and teaching on university level without a focus on a certain branch of physics or science. It is part of the Phynix project.
        
        ## Current projects
        
        The package is still in its early stage of planning and first implementations. It is currently not usable for any production-like application.
        
        
        ### Output
        
        What if "print" would simply save everything also into a file if I want to and not if I don't want to? Or if only those "prints" will be saved which I want to be saved?
        
        The answer is **Output** which does exactly the above (and more). But most of all, it does not change anything if not wanted.
        
        Simply replace **every** print with out.print. And everything works as usual. One line will let you save the output. If you like. And won't if you don't.
        
        Minimal example:
        
        ```python
        import uniphy as up
        
        out = up.output()
        out.print("Same as print", "\nBut I can be saved as well.")
        
        OR
        
        out = up.output("/my/path/to/folder")
        out.print("Same as print again, but will be saved this time")
        ```
