# nsopy -- Non-Smooth Optimization in Python

A set of first-order methods for solving

![optimization problem](./notebooks/img/min_opt.png "Non-Smooth Optimization Program")

when
* f(x) is convex, but not necessarily differentiable (has "kinks")
* the set ![X](./notebooks/img/XR.png) is convex

## Usage Examples

* See the [basic analytical example](./notebooks/AnalyticalExample.ipynb) for a complete working setup.

* How to get [approximate solutions to structured MILPs](./notebooks/ApplicationToDuality.ipynb) using Lagrangian duality.

</p>


We can also use these methods to decomposte stochastic multistage 
mixed integer programs ([preview](https://github.com/robin-vjc/nsopy-stoch)), which in turn allows 
the computation of approximate solutions to these models on distributed environments (e.g., on cloud infrastructure).

## Installation

The package is pip-installable:

```
pip install nsopy
```

Usage examples as above. Test cases for ```py.test``` runner are in ```./nsopy/tests/```.

## Currently Implemented Methods

* standard subgradient method, with constant and 1/k decaying stepsize
* cutting planes (*requires Gurobi*)
* a basic variant of the bundle method (*requires Gurobi*)
* [Nesterov] DSA and TA [quasi-monotone methods](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-014-0677-5) 
* [Nesterov] PGM, DGM and FGM, [universal gradient methods](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-014-0790-0)

**Note**: Cutting Panes and Bundle methods require Gurobi (and the python package ``gurobipy``) to be installed. 
If you are an academic, you can get a free license [here](http://www.gurobi.com/academia/for-universities]). 

**Requirements and Important Remarks:**

* The first-order oracle must also provide a projection function; [here is a list of cases](notebooks/img/simple_projections.png) for which 
projection is computationally inexpensive.

* Currently, all methods are implemented in Python. Numerical performance is not optimized, but they may
be still useful for quick comparisons or for applications in which the main computational burden is in
evaluating the first order oracle.
