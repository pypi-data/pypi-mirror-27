Description: 
        Asynchronous task queueing based on the Twisted framework, with task
        prioritization and a powerful worker interface. Worker implementations
        are included for running tasks asynchronously in the main thread, in
        separate threads, and in separate Python interpreters (multiprocessing).
        
        Includes an example package mcMandelbrot_ that generates Mandelbrot
        set images, row by row, demonstrating the power of asynchronous
        multi-core processing. An instance of ProcessQueue_ dispatches the
        computations for each row of pixels to workers running on separate
        Python processes. The color-mapped RGB results are collected as they
        come back and intelligently buffered for iterating in a proper
        sequence to a third-party PNG library that wouldn't ordinarily play
        nice with Twisted.
        
        Python 3 compatiblity is in the works, but not yet supported.
