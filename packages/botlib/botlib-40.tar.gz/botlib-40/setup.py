install
=======

Clone the source:

:: 

 bart@okdan:~$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/bthate/botlib

 You might need to do one of the following if the bot doesn't work:

 bart@okdan:~/botlib$ export PYTHONPATH="."
 bart@okdan:~/botlib$ export PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"

Another option is to download with pip3 and install globally:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ pip3 install botlib --upgrade

irc
===

Use -n <nick>, -s <server>, -c <channel> options to make the bot join the network:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ bot -i irc -n botlib -s irc.freenode.net -c \#botlib

You can use the -w option to write config values to ~/.bot/config/irc

xmpp
====

For the xmpp server use a ~/.sleekpass file with the password in it:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ cat "password" > ~/.sleekpass
 bart@okdan:~$ bot -i xmpp,rss --room=test@conference.localhost

users
=====

One needs to add a users origin to be able to give the bot commands. One can add a user with the meet command:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ bot meet user@server
 user user@server created

To give the user a permission you can use the perm command:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ bot perm user@server ps
 ok user@server

The u command show the json dump of a user object:

::

 bart@okdan:~$ bot u user@server 
 {
     "_container": {
         "default": "",
         "path": "/home/bart/.bot/user/2017-10-12/21:05:52.095737",
         "prefix": "object",
         "saved": "Thu Oct 12 21:07:03 2017",
         "signature": "c113c4125f8c2a88d5b312e283792ae019c61a52"
     },
     "_type": "<class 'botlib.object.Object'>",
     "origin": "user@server",
     "perms": [
         "USER",
         "PS"
     ],
     "user": "user@server"
 }

The default shell user is root@shell and gives access to all the commands that are available.
