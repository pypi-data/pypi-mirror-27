        tidynamics
        
        - performs the computation of mean-square displacements and correlation functions.
        - accepts as input NumPy arrays storing the positions and velocities of particles.
        - implements the so-called Fast Correlation Algorithm proposed by Kneller and others for the
          `nMOLDYN <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/nmoldyn/>`_ analysis program.
        - depends only `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.
        
        For a quick jump into tidynamics, have a look at the examples.
        
        The development of tidynamics is in early stages but it features several tests.
        
        Goals:
        
        - Minimal dependencies.
        - Serve as a reference implementation for common algorithms that are useful for molecular
          and stochastic simulations.
