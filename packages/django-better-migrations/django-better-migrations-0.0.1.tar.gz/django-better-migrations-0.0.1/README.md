========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbbarth/django-better-migrations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jbbarth/django-better-migrations)

This project aims at providing improvements to Django's default migration system.
The default migration system is over-engineered, sometimes dangerous, and not
team work friendly.
