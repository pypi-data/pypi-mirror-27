============================

Ver. 0.9.2 - 2014-Nov-18
---------------------------------------------------
* A minor release with several bug fixes.
* Bug fix in :class:`.Links`
* A more flexible implementation of the :meth:`~.Router.make_router` method
* Added the :meth:`~Router.copy` method for cloning a router class without
  its routes.

Ver. 0.9.1 - 2014-Oct-14
---------------------------------------------------
* Several fixes on :class:`.Html` initialisation and the :meth:`.Html.attr`
  method
* Critical bug fix in :class:`.WsgiHandler` when passing response middleware
* unidecode_ removed as hard dependency, wrong license
* The :ref:`Httpbin <tutorials-httpbin>` example shows how to
  use :ref:`application hooks <setting-section-application-hooks>`
* Added :meth:`.AsyncString.before_render` method to add callbacks executed
  just before an asynchronous string is rendered
* Fixed :ref:`--daemon <setting-daemon>` mode

Ver. 0.9.0 - 2014-Aug-04
---------------------------------------------------
* Works with trollius_ 1.0.1 which is now a dependency for all supported
  python versions
* Added :class:`.FlowControl` and :class:`.Timeout` protocol mixins,
  :class:`.PulsarProtocol` now inherits from :class:`.FlowControl`
* Better handling of streaming responses by the wsgi server
* Added the :ref:`--reload <setting-reload>` command line option and
  configuration parameter. If used, pulsar auto-reload code changes (useful
  during development)
* Added ``file`` log handler
* Javascript and Css defaults libraries moved to a new project
  (https://github.com/quantmind/jslibs) and the json file
  (http://quantmind.github.io/jslibs/libs.json) lazily loaded if needed by
  either :class:`.Links` or :class:`.Scripts` classes
* The :class:`.HttpClient` can be used in conjunction with
  :ref:`greenlet support <green-http>` to write implicit asynchronous HTTP
  requests
* Finally removed the ``get_request_loop`` method. Full compatibility with
  asyncio
* Bug fix in :class:`.Store` constructor
* When throwing an :class:`.ImproperlyConfigured` exception, pulsar will log
  and error without the full stack-trace
  (:class:`~.ImproperlyConfigured.exit_code` attribute is set to 2).
  Useful when stopping execution because of a wrong input rather than an
  internal exception
* Critical bug fix in :class:`.Router` when children are added via a decorated
  method
* trollius_ and unidecode_ added as dependencies in the ``setup.py``
  script during installation
* Better :func:`.slugify` function
* :class:`.EventHandler` requires a valid :ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>`
  during initialisation
* Removed ``arbiter`` and ``monitor`` modules from ``async``, one :class:`.Actor`
  class only, implementation differences handled by the different underlying
  :class:`.Concurrency` classes.
* The :class:`.Config` adds the default values of excluded settings to the
  :attr:`.Config.params` dictionary. In this way the parameters cannot be set
  on the command line but still be available.


Ver. 0.8.4 - 2014-Jul-07
---------------------------------------------------
* Several bug fixes in wsgi :class:`.Router`
* Added :attr:`.Route.name` attribute
* :class:`.WsgiResponse` does not send cookies back to the client by default

---------------------------------------------------
* Fixed critical bug in python 2 for :func:`.middleware_in_executor`
* Set trollius logger to warning by default (same as asyncio)
* Added :meth:`.WsgiRequest.redirect` and :meth:`.Router.redirect` methods
  to simplify redirection.
* Renamed css container as :class:`.Links`

Ver. 0.8.2 - 2014-May-30
---------------------------------------------------
* :class:`.ProtocolConsumer` has its own ``_loop`` attribute rather than
  obtaining indirectly from the underling :class:`.Connection`.
  This avoids several logging errors when a connection is dropped
* Added utilities to execute :postgresql:`PostgreSql <>` queries via
  psycopg2_ in asynchronous mode via the :mod:`~pulsar.apps.greenio` module.
* Django pulse application can be run asynchronously
  when using PostgreSql database.
  It requires the :greenlet:`greenlet module <>`
* Added :attr:`.Head.embedded_js` for adding javascript code directly in the
  :class:`.HtmlDocument`
* Improved management of ``meta`` tags in the HTML5 :class:`.Head` class
* Added :class:`.OAuth1` and :class:`.OAuth2` hooks to the
  :mod:`~pulsar.apps.http` module (alpha and untested)
* Bug fix in :class:`.HttpParser` when ``Transfer-Encoding=chunked``
* Added default javascript libraries to the :class:`.HtmlDocument`
* Both wsgi request wrappers and content don't use coroutines but
  straight :class:`~asyncio.Future` for compatibility with other frameworks.
* pulsar can be imported and used (with limited scope) in the google appengine

Ver. 0.8.1 - 2014-Apr-14
---------------------------------------------------
* Added :mod:`pulsar.apps.greenio` application for writing asynchronous code
  using the greenlet_ library.
* Moved :class:`.PulsarDS` server into its own :mod:`pulsar.apps.ds`
  module
* The task application can run on redis.
* Added twisted integration (alpha)
* Removed ``Server`` and ``Date`` from Hop headers
* Fixed installation problem with extensions
* More documentation for data stores
* Added ability to serve directories in :class:`.MediaRouter` if the
  path contain a ``default_file`` (``index.html``). This also means
  ``show_indexes`` in :class:`.MediaRouter` initialisation is by default
  ``False``.
* The callable method in a :class:`.AsyncString` always returns a
  :class:`~asyncio.Future`.

Ver. 0.8.0 - 2014-Mar-06
---------------------------------------------------
* **Backward incompatible version**

* **Asyncio Integration**

  * asyncio_ integration with several changes in internals. The integration
    works with all supported python versions: 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4
  * Asyncio event loop functions :func:`~asyncio.get_event_loop`,
    :func:`~asyncio.new_event_loop`,
    are available from pulsar top level module as well as asyncio.
    In other words ``from pulsar import get_event_loop`` and
    ``from asyncio import get_event_loop`` are equivalent (provided pulsar is
    imported first).
  * Replaced the ``Deferred`` class with :class:`asyncio.Future`.
  * Replaced the ``EventLoop`` class with
    :ref:`asyncio event loop <asyncio-event-loop>`.

* **Core library**

  * Removed support for python 2.6 and python 3.2.
  * :ref:`Coroutines <coroutine>` can return a value via the
    :func:`.coroutine_return` function.
  * Added :func:`.run_in_loop` high level function. This utility
    runs a callable in the event loop thread and returns a
    :class:`~asyncio.Future` called back once the callable has
    a result/exception.
  * Added :func:`.in_loop` and :func:`.task` decorators for
    member functions of :ref:`async objects <async-object>`.
  * :func:`.async` is now a function, not a decorator.
  * Added the new :class:`.Pool` class for managing a pool of asynchronous
    connection with a server.
  * Embedding third-party asynchronous frameworks can be achieved via the
    new :func:`.add_async_binding` function.
  * Removed ``Client`` class and replaced by :class:`.AbstractClient` which
    in turns is a subclass of connections :class:`.Producer`.
  * Removed ``force_sync`` parameter when creating synchronous components.
    Synchronous objects are now created by explicitly passing a new event
    loop during initialisation.
    Check the the :ref:`synchronous components tutorial <tutorials-synchronous>`
    for details.
  * Added the :ref:`data-store <setting-data_store>` setting for specifying
    the default data store of a running application.
  * Added the :ref:`exc-id <setting-exc_id>` setting which uniquely specify
    the identity of a running application. This is useful during testing.
  * Unified the handshake across all actors

* **New data store module**

  * New :mod:`pulsar.apps.data` module for managing asynchronous data stores.
  * Two stores available: redis_ and :ref:`pulsar-ds <pulsar-data-store>`.
  * Additional stores can be created by subclassing the :class:`.Store`
    abstract class and registering it via the :func:`.register_store` function.
  * The :ref:`pulsar-ds <pulsar-data-store>` is a python implementation of
    the popular redis server. It implements most redis commands including
    scripting.

* **Websockets**

  * The web socket :meth:`~pulsar.apps.ws.WS.on_open` method is invoked soon
    after upgrade headers are sent. No need to send a message from the client
    to kick start the bidirectional communication.
  * Websocket C extensions for faster parsing/masking.
  * Added support for sending :meth:`~pulsar.utils.websocket.FrameParser.close`
    frames with an optional status code, and for parsing close frames
    with a body via the :func:`.parse_close` function (for websocket clients).

* **WSGI**

  * Better handling of cookies in :class:`.WsgiResponse`
  * :class:`.Router` can have children even if it is a leaf node
  * Dropped support for http-parser_, only HTTP python parser used

* **Miscellaneous**

  * The :mod:`pulsar.apps.pubsub` has been removed. Publish/subscribe
    implementations are now available in the new :mod:`pulsar.apps.data` module.
  * The ``Backend`` class has been removed.
  * Improved django example with possibility to
    choose different data stores for messages.
  * Removed the twisted integration module and moved it to the example directory.
    The integration is not tested enough and therefore cannot be part of the
    main distribution.
  * :class:`.Application` does not require to create picklable objects.
  * More robust serialisation of ``TestCase`` methods when used with the
    :func:`.run_on_arbiter` decorator.
  * The shell application runs on a worker thread in the
    arbiter domain.
  * The :meth:`.Configurator.start` method returns a :class:`~asyncio.Future`
    called back once the applications in the configurator are running.
  * Added a new script for building releases for pypi (``buildrelease.py``)

* **1,166 regression tests**, **91% coverage**.

Ver. 0.7.4 - 2013-Dec-22
---------------------------------------------------

  including:
  * SSL support
  * Proxy and Tunnelling
  * Cookie support
  * File upload

* Code coverage can be turned on by using the ``--coverage`` option. By
  passing in the command line ``--coveralls`` when testing, coverage is
  published to coveralls.io.
* WSGI responses 400 Bad Request to request with no ``Host`` header if the
  request URI is not an absolute URI. Follows the `rfc2616 sec 5.2`_
  guidelines.
* Removed the specialised application worker and monitor classes.
  Use standard actor and monitor with specialised
  :ref:`start hooks <actor-hooks>` instead.
* Removed the global event dispatcher. No longer used. Less global variables
  the better.

  * New pep-3156_ compatible :class:`.EventLoop`.
  * Added the :meth:`.Deferred.cancel` method to cancel asynchronous
    callbacks.
  * :class:`.Deferred` accepts a *timeout* as initialisation parameter.
    If a value greater than 0 is given, the deferred will add a timeout to the
    event loop to cancel itself in *timeout* seconds.
  * :class:`.DeferredTask` stops after the first error by default.
    This class replace the old DeferredGenerator and provides a cleaner
    API with inline syntax.
  * Added :func:`.async_sleep` function.

* **Actors**

  * :class:`.Actor` internal message passing uses the (unmasked)
    websocket protocol in a bidirectional communication between the
    :class:`.Arbiter` and actors.
  * Spawning and stopping actors is monitored using a timeout set at 5 seconds.
  * Added :mod:`pulsar.async.consts` module for low level pulsar constants.
  * Removed the requestloop attribute, the actor event loop is now accessed
    via the :attr:`.Actor._loop` attribute or via the pep-3156_
    function ``get_event_loop``.

* **Applications**

  * Added ability to add Websocket sub-protocols and extensions.
  * New asynchronous :class:`.HttpClient` with websocket support.
  * Support http-parser_ for faster http protocol parsing.

  * Introduced in this application.
  * Added :func:`~.set_async` function which can be used to change
    the asynchronous discovery functions :func:`.maybe_async`
    and :func:`.maybe_failure`. The function is used in the
    implementation of twisted integration and could
    be used in conjunction with other asynchronous libraries as well.
  * New Webmail example application using twisted
    IMAP4 protocol implementation.

* Added ``FrozenDict``.
* **444 regression tests**, **87% coverage**.
