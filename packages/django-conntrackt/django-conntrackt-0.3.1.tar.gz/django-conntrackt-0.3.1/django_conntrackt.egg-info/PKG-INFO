        About Django Conntrackt
        =======================
        
        Django Conntrackt is a simple application targeted at system
        administrators and integrators that deploy servers at client's
        premises that need a way to keep track of required network
        connectivity.
        
        Application allows tracking of required network communications between
        different servers, routers, client workstations, and even whole
        networks/sub-networks.
        
        In addition to keeping track of connections, the application has the ability to
        generate simple *iptables* rules based on the connections specified. The
        generated rules can be easily applied using the *iptables-restore* utility.
        
        At time of this writing, Django Conntrackt is compatible with the
        following Django and Python versions:
        
        - *Python 2.7.x*
        - *Django 1.5.x*
        
        
        Why was this application created?
        ---------------------------------
        
        The application was created in order to alleviate painful and error prone
        tracking of IP addresses and network communications inside of spreadsheet
        files. Another reason was the need to create simple iptables rules based on this
        information with as little hassle as possible.
        
        The *iptables* generation requirements for Django Conntrackt were farily simple,
        and do not include any complex functionality. It all boils down to rejecting all
        communication except for explicitly defined links.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Django Conntrackt sports a number of useful features for system administrators
        and integrators:
        
        * Managing entities through multiple projects (separating the entities
          per-project basis).
        * Grouping entities inside of a project in one or more locations (which can be
          either logical or physical).
        * Specifying entities that represent servers, routers, workstations, networks,
          subnets or any other networked device or abstraction within a network.
        * Specifying multiple network interfaces for each entity.
        * Specifying the communication link between two entities, which includes
          information such as protocol and port.
        * Generation of *iptables* rules for devices based on GNU/Linux that can be
          consumed by the *iptables-restore* utility.
        * Generation of *iptables* rules on per-location/project basis (multiple
          *iptables* rule files inside of a single *ZIP* file).
