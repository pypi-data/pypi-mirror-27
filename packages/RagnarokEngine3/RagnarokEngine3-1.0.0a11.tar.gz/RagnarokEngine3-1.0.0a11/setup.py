Ragnarok Engine was first started in 2010 by Clinton Myers, it is small and concise 2D game engine built on top 
of Pygame to make game creation easier.

While Pygame is a library, Ragnarok attempts to assume the role of an engine, featuring many capabilities that would
take a lot of work to create from the ground up in Pygame.

The engine is built in such a way that it attempts to be used under any scenario and game environment.
It is easy to set up, maintain, and extend for your particular needs.
This code is being expanded and ported to python 3.6
