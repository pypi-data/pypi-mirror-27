We propose an Astronomical SYnthetic Data Observatory (ASYDO),
a virtual service that generates synthetic spectroscopic data in
the form of data cubes. The objective of the tool is not to produce
accurate astrophysical simulations, but to generate a large number
of labelled synthetic data, to assess advanced computing algorithms
for astronomy and to develop novel Big Data algorithms.
