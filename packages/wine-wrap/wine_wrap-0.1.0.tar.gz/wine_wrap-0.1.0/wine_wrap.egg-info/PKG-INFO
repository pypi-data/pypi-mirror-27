        ==========
        
        A versioned wine-prefix management tool with memory-shared prefixes.
        
        This tool simplifies the maintenance of individual wine-prefixes per
        executable. Each prefix is version-controlled using git, allowing for
        reproducible setups. Furthermore (if supported by host system), the
        prefixes are stored as subvolumes on a BTRFS image. This makes storing
        them more memory efficient by only saving differences between each
        installation.

        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        A typical use-case would be to first run an installer, and then the
        created executable in the same wine-prefix. To do so, first run the
        installer (as well as winecfg beforehand) and name the used prefix:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ wine_wrap run --configure --name MyOwnPrefix installer.exe
            [..]
        
        Afterwards, find the newly installed executable within this prefix and
        associate it correctly:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ wine_wrap scan MyOwnPrefix
            [..]
             > "/path/to/executable.exe"
            [..]
            $ wine_wrap set "/path/to/executable.exe" MyOwnPrefix
        
        We can then make sure that the correct script-prefix associations are
        set:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ wine_wrap show
            --- MyOwnPrefix ---
             > installer.exe
             > executable.exe
        
        It is then possible to simply run the executable in the correct
        wine-prefix:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ wine_wrap run /path/to/executable.exe
            [..]
        
        If we don't need the scripts anymore, we can delete them in the end:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ wine_wrap clear --delete-prefixes --prefix MyOwnPrefix
            [..]
