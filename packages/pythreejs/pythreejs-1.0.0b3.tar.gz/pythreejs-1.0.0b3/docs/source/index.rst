=====================================

Version: |release|

**pythreejs** is a `Jupyter widgets`_ based `notebook`_ extension that allows Jupyter to leverage
the WebGL capabilities of modern browsers by creating bindings to the javascript library `three.js`_.

with other interactive tools for notebooks.
