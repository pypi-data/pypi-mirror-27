``variants`` is a library that provides syntactic sugar for creating alternate forms of functions and other callables, in the same way that alternate constructors are class methods that provide alternate forms of the constructor function.

To create a function with variants, simply decorate the primary form with ``@variants.primary``, which then adds the ``.variant`` decorator to the original function, which can be used to register new variants. Here is a simple example of a function that prints text, with variants that specify the source of the text to print:

.. code-block:: python

    import variants

    @variants.primary
    def print_text(txt):
        print(txt)

    @print_text.variant('from_file')
    def print_text(fobj):
        print_text(fobj.read())

    @print_text.variant('from_filepath')
    def print_text(fpath):
        with open(fpath, 'r') as f:
            print_text.from_file(f)

    @print_text.variant('from_url')
    def print_text(url):
        import requests
        r = requests.get(url)
        print_text(r.text)


``print_text`` and its variants can be used as such:

.. code-block:: python

    print_text('Hello, world!')                 # Hello, world!

    # Create a text file
    with open('hello_world.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Hello, world (from file)')

    # Print from an open file object
    with open('hello_world.txt', 'r') as f:
        print_text.from_file(f)                 # Hello, world (from file)

    # Print from the path to a file object
    print_text.from_filepath('hello_world.txt') # Hello, world (from file)

    # Print from a URL
    hw_url = 'https://ganssle.io/files/hello_world.txt'
    print_text.from_url(hw_url)                 # Hello, world! (from url)
