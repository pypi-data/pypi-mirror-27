Introduction
------------

Pnb is an interactive environment for python programming which
follows the notebook concept of mathematica and jupyter. Notebooks are
a pleasant way to develop and document python code and to store ideas.

Unlike other python notebook interfaces such as jupyter or spyder,
pnb is very lightweight and can be easily to embeded in wxpython
applications.


Features
--------

Most notable features are:

- syntax highlighting
- command completion (tab-key)
- introspection (F1-key)
- built-in graphics
- plotting via matplotlib
- BSD-license


Pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except
python and `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_. Pynotebook runs
completely out of the box and is therefore easy to embed and
distribute.
