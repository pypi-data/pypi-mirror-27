The 'paths' directory contains the paths of utilities required in the code
generation process. They should be automatically generated by the installation
process but can be manually updated at a later stage if required.

The paths that can be set in this directory (as the contents of plain text
files with '_path' appended to the file name e.g. 'nrnivmodl_path') are:

    * nrnivmodl
    * modlunit
    * nest-config
    
If a path file is not provided then the PATH environment variable will be
searched for the utility. Note that in this case it is important to double
check that the libninemlnrn.so is compiled with the same C compiler as the
version of NEURON the nrnivmodl on the PATH refers to.
