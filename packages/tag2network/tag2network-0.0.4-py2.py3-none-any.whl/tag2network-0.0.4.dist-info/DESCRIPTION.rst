Build similarity network from any dataset where a set of keywords or other                           tags is assigned to each document. The network is build by computing                           cosine simiarity between each document, based on their tag sets, and                           thresholding the similarities to produce a network.  Includes ability to                           extract ngrams from blocks of text and use as tags
