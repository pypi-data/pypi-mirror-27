Description

tenancy is simply the root compartment). See Where to Get the
Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID.

Options
=======


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the

"List" call.


--limit [integer]

cannot provide the --limit option.

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with --all or --limit, and ignored otherwise.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
