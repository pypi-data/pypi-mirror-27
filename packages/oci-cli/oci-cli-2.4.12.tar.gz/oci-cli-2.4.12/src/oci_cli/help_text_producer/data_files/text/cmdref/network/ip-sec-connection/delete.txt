delete
******


Description
===========

Deletes the specified IPSec connection. If your goal is to disable the
IPSec VPN between your VCN and on-premises network, it's easiest to
simply detach the DRG but keep all the IPSec VPN components intact. If
you were to delete all the components and then later need to create an
IPSec VPN again, you would need to configure your on-premises router
again with the new information returned from CreateIPSecConnection.

This is an asynchronous operation. The connection's *lifecycleState*
will change to TERMINATING temporarily until the connection is
completely removed.


Usage
=====

   oci network ip-sec-connection delete [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--ipsc-id [text]
----------------

The OCID of the IPSec connection. [required]


--if-match [text]
-----------------

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.


--force
-------

Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used


-?, -h, --help
--------------

Show this message and exit.
