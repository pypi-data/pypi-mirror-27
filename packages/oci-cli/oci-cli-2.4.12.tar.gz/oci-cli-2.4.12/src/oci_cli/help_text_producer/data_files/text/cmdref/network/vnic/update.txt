Usage
=====

   oci network vnic update [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--vnic-id [text]
----------------

The OCID of the VNIC. [required]


--display-name [text]
---------------------

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.


--hostname-label [text]
-----------------------

The hostname for the VNIC's primary private IP. Used for DNS. The
value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully
qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, *bminstance-1* in FQDN
*bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com*). Must be unique across
all VNICs in the subnet and comply with RFC 952 and RFC 1123. The
value appears in the Vnic object and also the PrivateIp object
returned by ListPrivateIps and GetPrivateIp.

For more information, see DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network.


--skip-source-dest-check [boolean]
----------------------------------

Whether the source/destination check is disabled on the VNIC. Defaults
to *false*, which means the check is performed. For information about
why you would skip the source/destination check, see Using a Private
IP as a Route Target.

Example: *true*


--if-match [text]
-----------------

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used


-?, -h, --help
--------------

Show this message and exit.
