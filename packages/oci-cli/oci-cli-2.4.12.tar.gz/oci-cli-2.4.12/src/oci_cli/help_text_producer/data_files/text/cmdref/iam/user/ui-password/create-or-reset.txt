create-or-reset
***************


Description
===========

Creates a new Console one-time password for the specified user. For
more information about user credentials, see User Credentials.

Use this operation after creating a new user, or if a user forgets
their password. The new one-time password is returned to you in the
response, and you must securely deliver it to the user. They'll be
prompted to change this password the next time they sign in to the
Console. If they don't change it within 7 days, the password will
expire and you'll need to create a new one-time password for the user.

**Note:** The user's Console login is the unique name you specified
when you created the user (see CreateUser).
