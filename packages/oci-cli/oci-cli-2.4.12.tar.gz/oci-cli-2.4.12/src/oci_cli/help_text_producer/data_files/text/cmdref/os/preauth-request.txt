preauth-request

Description
===========

Pre-authenticated requests provide a way to allow access to specified
object operations for a fixed amount of time without performing
authentication.

The access-uri will only be returned from the create operation for a
pre-authenticated request (not get or list).  Note the access-uri
value upon creation in order to use the pre-authenticated request
later.
