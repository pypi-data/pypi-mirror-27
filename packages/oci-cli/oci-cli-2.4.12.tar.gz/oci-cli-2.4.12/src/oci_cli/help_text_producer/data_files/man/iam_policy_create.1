.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new policy in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or another of your compartments). If you\(aqre new to policies, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a \fIname\fP for the policy, which must be unique across all policies in your tenancy and cannot be changed.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the policy (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdatePolicy\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Policy/UpdatePolicy\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify one or more policy statements in the statements array. For information about writing policies, see \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP> and \fI\%Common Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
New policies take effect typically within 10 seconds.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment containing the policy (either the tenancy or another compartment). [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name you assign to the policy during creation. The name must be unique across all policies in the tenancy and cannot be changed. [required]
.SS \-\-statements [complex type]
.sp
An array of policy statements written in the policy language. See \fI\%How Policies Work\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm\fP> and \fI\%Common Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/commonpolicies.htm\fP>\&. [required]
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax. This must be provided in JSON format. See API reference for additional help.
.sp
Example: \(aq["statement 1","statement 2"]\(aq
.SS \-\-description [text]
.sp
The description you assign to the policy during creation. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. [required]
.SS \-\-version\-date [text]
.sp
The version of the policy. If null or set to an empty string, when a request comes in for authorization, the policy will be evaluated according to the current behavior of the services at that moment. If set to a particular date (YYYY\-MM\-DD), the policy will be evaluated according to the behavior of the services on that date.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
