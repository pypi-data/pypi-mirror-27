.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a boot disk image for the specified instance or imports an exported image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.
.sp
When creating a new image, you must provide the OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image, and the OCID of the compartment containing that instance. For more information about images, see \fI\%Managing Custom Images\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/managingcustomimages.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an exported image from Object Storage, you specify the source information in \fI\%ImageSourceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/ImageSourceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an image based on the namespace, bucket name, and object name, use \fI\%ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When importing an image based on the Object Storage URL, use \fI\%ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails\fP>\&. See \fI\%Object Storage URLs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm#URLs\fP> and \fI\%pre\-authenticated requests\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Object/Tasks/managingaccess.htm#pre-auth\fP> for constructing URLs for image import/export.
.sp
For more information about importing exported images, see \fI\%Image Import/Export\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Tasks/imageimportexport.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the image, which is simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. See \fI\%UpdateImage\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Image/UpdateImage\fP>\&. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment containing the instance you want to use as the basis for the image. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the image. It does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
You cannot use an Oracle\-provided image name as a custom image name.
.sp
Example: \fIMy Oracle Linux image\fP
.SS \-\-image\-source\-details [complex type]
.sp
[DEPRECATED] The use of the \fIoci compute image create\fP command to import an image from Object Storage is deprecated.
.sp

Please use the \fIoci compute image import\fP command instead.
.sp
Details for creating an image through import
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.sp
Example: \(aq{ "objectName": "image\-to\-import.qcow2", "bucketName": "MyBucket", "namespaceName": "MyNamespace", "sourceType": "objectStorageTuple" }\(aq
.sp
or
.sp
\(aq{ "sourceUri": "\fI\%https://objectstorage.us\-phoenix\-1.oraclecloud.com/n/MyNamespace/b/MyBucket/o/image\-to\-import.qcow2\fP", "sourceType": "objectStorageUri" }\(aq
.SS \-\-instance\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
.SS \-?, \-h, \-\-help
.sp
Show this message and exit.
