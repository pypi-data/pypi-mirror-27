create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new volume in the specified compartment. Volumes can be
created in sizes ranging from 50 GB (51200 MB) to 16 TB (16777216 MB),
in 1 GB (1024 MB) increments. By default, volumes are 1 TB (1048576
MB). For general information about block volumes, see Overview of
Block Volume Service.

A volume and instance can be in separate compartments but must be in
the same Availability Domain. For information about access control and
compartments, see Overview of the IAM Service. For information about
Availability Domains, see Regions and Availability Domains. To get a
list of Availability Domains, use the *ListAvailabilityDomains*
operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the volume, which is
simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique,
and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

   oci bv volume create [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--availability-domain [text]
----------------------------

The Availability Domain of the volume. Example: *Uocm:PHX-AD-1*.

This is optional when cloning a volume as the newly created volume
will be created in the same Availability Domain as its source. This is
required when creating an empty volume or restoring a volume from a
backup.


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment that contains the volume. This is optional
when cloning a volume or restoring a volume from a backup. If it is
not supplied then the volume will be created in the same compartment
as the source. This is requied when creating an empty volume.


--display-name [text]
---------------------

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.


--size-in-gbs [integer]
-----------------------

The size of the volume in GBs. This option cannot be supplied when
cloning a volume or restoring a volume from a backup


--size-in-mbs [integer]
-----------------------

[DEPRECATED] The size of the volume in MBs. The value must be a
multiple of 1024. This field is deprecated. Use --size-in-gbs instead.
This option cannot be supplied when cloning a volume or restoring a
volume from a backup


--source-volume-id [text]
-------------------------

The OCID of a Block volume in the same Availability Domain from which
the data should be cloned to the newly created volume. You can specify
either this or --volume-backup-id but not both. If neither is
specified then the new Block volume will be empty.


--volume-backup-id [text]
-------------------------

The OCID of the volume backup from which the data should be restored
on the newly created volume. You can specify either this or --source-
volume-id but not both. If neither is specified then the new Block
volume will be empty.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
