create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new backup in the specified database based on the request
parameters you provide. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to
configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API
for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with
your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your
previously configured unmanaged backups to work.


Usage
=====

   oci db backup create [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--database-id [text]
--------------------

The OCID of the database. [required]

--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
