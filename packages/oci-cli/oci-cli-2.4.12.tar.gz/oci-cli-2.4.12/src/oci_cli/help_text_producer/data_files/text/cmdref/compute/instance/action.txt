action
******


Description
===========

Performs one of the power actions (start, stop, softreset, or reset)
on the specified instance.

**start** - power on

**stop** - power off

**softreset** - ACPI shutdown and power on

**reset** - power off and power on

Note that the **stop** state has no effect on the resources you
consume. Billing continues for instances that you stop, and related
resources continue to apply against any relevant quotas. You must
terminate an instance (TerminateInstance) to remove its resources from
billing and quotas.
