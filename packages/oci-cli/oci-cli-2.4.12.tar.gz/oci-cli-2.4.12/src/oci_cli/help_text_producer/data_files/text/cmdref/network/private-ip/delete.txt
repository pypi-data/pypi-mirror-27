delete
******


Description
===========

Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the
object's OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet's pool
of available addresses.

This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are
automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.

**Important:** If a secondary private IP is the target of a route
rule, unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole
and the traffic will be dropped.


Usage
=====

   oci network private-ip delete [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--private-ip-id [text]
----------------------

The private IP's OCID. [required]


--if-match [text]
-----------------

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.


--force
-------

Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
