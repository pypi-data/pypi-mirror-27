.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-ns, \-\-namespace [text]
.sp
The top\-level namespace used for the request. [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The ID of the compartment in which to create the bucket. [required]
.SS \-\-name [text]
.sp
The name of the bucket.
.SS \-\-metadata [text]
.sp
Arbitrary string keys and values for user\-defined metadata. Must be in JSON format. Example: \(aq{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}\(aq
.SS \-\-public\-access\-type [NoPublicAccess|ObjectRead]
.sp
The type of public access available on this bucket. Allows authenticated caller to access the bucket or contents of this bucket. By default a bucket is set to NoPublicAccess. It is treated as NoPublicAccess when this value is not specified. When the type is NoPublicAccess the bucket does not allow any public access. When the type is ObjectRead the bucket allows public access to the GetObject operation only.
.SS \-\-storage\-tier [Standard|Archive]
.sp
The type of storage tier for this bucket. A bucket is set to Standard tier by default, which means the bucket will be put in the standard storage tier. When the Archive tier type is set explicitly, the bucket is put in the Archive Storage tier. The storage\-tier property is immutable after bucket is created.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
