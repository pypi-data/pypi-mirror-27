.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A \fIprivate IP\fP is a conceptual term that refers to a private IP address and related properties.
The \fIprivateIp\fP object is the API representation of a private IP.
.sp
Each instance has a \fIprimary private IP\fP that is automatically created and
assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
can\(aqt remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
.sp
You can add \fIsecondary private IPs\fP to a VNIC after it\(aqs created. For more
information, see the \fIprivateIp\fP operations and also
\fI\%IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP Only
\fI\%ListPrivateIps\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps\fP> and
\fI\%GetPrivateIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp\fP> work with
\fIprimary\fP private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead
work with instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP\(aqs
properties come from the values you specify in
\fI\%CreateVnicDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/CreateVnicDetails\fP> when calling either
\fI\%LaunchInstance\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Instance/LaunchInstance\fP> or
\fI\%AttachVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/AttachVnic\fP>\&. To update the hostname
for a primary private IP, you use \fI\%UpdateVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/UpdateVnic\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized,
talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
\fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.

.SS delete
.SS Description
.sp
Unassigns and deletes the specified private IP. You must specify the object\(aqs OCID. The private IP address is returned to the subnet\(aqs pool of available addresses.
.sp
This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are automatically unassigned and deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP If a secondary private IP is the \fI\%target of a route rule\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm#privateip\fP>, unassigning it from the VNIC causes that route rule to blackhole and the traffic will be dropped.

.SS Options
.SS \-\-private\-ip\-id [text]
.sp
The private IP\(aqs OCID. [required]
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
.SS \-?, \-h, \-\-help
.sp
Show this message and exit.
.SS get
.SS Description
.sp
Gets the specified private IP. You must specify the object\(aqs OCID. Alternatively, you can get the object by using \fI\%ListPrivateIps\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps\fP> with the private IP address (for example, 10.0.3.3) and subnet OCID.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

\- Subnet OCID.
\- VNIC OCID.

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
based on its private IP address (for example, 10.0.3.3)  and not its OCID.
For comparison, \fI\%GetPrivateIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp\fP> requires the OCID.
