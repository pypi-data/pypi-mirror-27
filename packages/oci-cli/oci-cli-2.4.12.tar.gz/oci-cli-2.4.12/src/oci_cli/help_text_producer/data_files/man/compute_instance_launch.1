.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified Availability Domain. For general information about instances, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about Availability Domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet\(aqs CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic\fP> with the VNIC ID.
.sp
You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-availability\-domain [text]
.sp
The Availability Domain of the instance.
.sp
Example: \fIUocm:PHX\-AD\-1\fP [required]
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-image\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the image used to boot the instance. [required]
.SS \-\-shape [text]
.sp
The shape of an instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and other resources allocated to the instance.
.sp
You can enumerate all available shapes by calling \fI\%ListShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes\fP>\&. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Example: \fIMy bare metal instance\fP
.SS \-\-extended\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide.  They serve a similar purpose and functionality from fields in the \(aqmetadata\(aq object.
.sp
They are distinguished from \(aqmetadata\(aq fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas \(aqmetadata\(aq fields are string/string maps only).
.sp
If you don\(aqt need nested metadata values, it is strongly advised to avoid using this object and use the Metadata object instead.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-hostname\-label [text]
.sp
The hostname for the VNIC that is created during instance launch. Used for DNS. The value is the hostname portion of the instance\(aqs fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g., \fIbminstance\-1\fP in FQDN \fIbminstance\-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com\fP). Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with \fI\%RFC 952\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952\fP> and \fI\%RFC 1123\fP <\fBhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123\fP>\&. The value cannot be changed, and it can be retrieved from the \fI\%Vnic object\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/\fP>\&.
.sp
For more information, see \fI\%DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example: \fIbminstance\-1\fP
.SS \-\-ipxe\-script\-file [filename]
.sp
This is an advanced option.
.sp
When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.
.sp
If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.
.sp
The default iPXE script connects to the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
.sp
For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see \fI\%Bring Your Own Image\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For more information about iPXE, see \fI\%http://ipxe.org\fP\&.
.SS \-\-metadata [complex type]
.sp
Custom metadata key/value pairs that you provide, such as the SSH public key required to connect to the instance. For more info see documentation: \fI\%https://docs.us\-phoenix\-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP\&. This must be provided in JSON format.
.sp
Note: user_data and ssh_authorized_keys can instead be specified using the parameters \-\-user\-data\-file and \-\-ssh\-authorized\-keys\-file.
.sp
Example: \(aq{"ssh_authorized_keys": "ssh\-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDbVpuGODmhsRZOLWNgm0aEYUoWIDSPNWHmg2M6mZpmZNHfiNfx2dSofxUpKOiu5S8Th52AuAHSmkzNe6lXBO9wxnjOvkowe1mAleRTEl8zPI8Jkz6HrmJCzHEtS04kC4bx+tXRZhIfRq1uGaPcriKyquTnQs52Ahoxgw5vdXXQMwxWZLAcyaP01JrZwcUqPlB/GRiBFSTj0E/AIiVW3APNME5HjreOd/djjPRpvWu7AUpOqskG38kr8lhxo1hJifqeMg5W7cQsecTLJHgTDAPJD68ujM93jdzV2llIXwR1zyl80i6c3lDLyLgUrCLM0R1xex/zITTdT6/Z84buS/Xl my public key"}\(aq
.SS \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the subnet where the VNIC attached to this instance will be created.
.SS \-\-vnic\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the default VNIC attached to this instance. Does not have to be unique.
.SS \-\-assign\-public\-ip [boolean]
.sp
Whether the default VNIC attached to this instance should be assigned a public IP address. Defaults to whether the subnet is public or private. If not set and the VNIC is being created in a private subnet (i.e., where prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true in the Subnet), then no public IP address is assigned. If not set and the subnet is public (prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=false), then a public IP address is assigned. If set to true and prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true, an error is returned.
.SS \-\-private\-ip [text]
.sp
A private IP address of your choice to assign to the default VNIC attached to this instance. Must be an available IP address within the subnet\(aqs CIDR. If no value is specified, a private IP address from the subnet will be automatically assigned.
.SS \-\-skip\-source\-dest\-check [boolean]
.sp
Indicates whether Source/Destination check is disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP, in which case we enable Source/Destination check on the VNIC.
.SS \-\-user\-data\-file [filename]
.sp
A file containing data that Cloud\-Init can use to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud\-Init configuration. This parameter is a convenience wrapper around the \(aquser_data\(aq field of the \-\-metadata parameter.  Populating both values in the same call will result in an error. For more info see Cloud\-Init documentation: \fI\%https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/format.html\fP\&.
.SS \-\-ssh\-authorized\-keys\-file [filename]
.sp
A file containing one or more public SSH keys to be included in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the authorized_keys file. This parameter is a convenience wrapper around the \(aqssh_authorized_keys\(aq field of the \-\-metadata parameter. Populating both values in the same call will result in an error. For more info see documentation: \fI\%https://docs.us\-phoenix\-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP\&.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
.SS \-?, \-h, \-\-help
.sp
Show this message and exit.
