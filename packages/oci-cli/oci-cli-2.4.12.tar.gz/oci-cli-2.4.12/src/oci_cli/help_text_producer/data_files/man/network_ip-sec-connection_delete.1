.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified IPSec connection. If your goal is to disable the IPSec VPN between your VCN and on\-premises network, it\(aqs easiest to simply detach the DRG but keep all the IPSec VPN components intact. If you were to delete all the components and then later need to create an IPSec VPN again, you would need to configure your on\-premises router again with the new information returned from \fI\%CreateIPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/CreateIPSecConnection\fP>\&.
.sp
This is an asynchronous operation. The connection\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will change to TERMINATING temporarily until the connection is completely removed.
