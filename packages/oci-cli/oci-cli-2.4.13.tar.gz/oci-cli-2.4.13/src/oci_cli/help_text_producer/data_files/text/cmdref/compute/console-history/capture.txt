capture
*******


Description
===========

Captures the most recent serial console data (up to a megabyte) for
the specified instance.

The *CaptureConsoleHistory* operation works with the other console
history operations as described below.

1. Use *CaptureConsoleHistory* to request the capture of up to a
   megabyte of the most recent console history. This call returns a
   *ConsoleHistory* object. The object will have a state of REQUESTED.
   2. Wait for the capture operation to succeed by polling
   *GetConsoleHistory* with the identifier of the console history
   metadata. The state of the *ConsoleHistory* object will go from
   REQUESTED to GETTING-HISTORY and then SUCCEEDED (or FAILED). 3. Use
   *GetConsoleHistoryContent* to get the actual console history data
   (not the metadata). 4. Optionally, use *DeleteConsoleHistory* to
   delete the console history metadata and the console history data.
