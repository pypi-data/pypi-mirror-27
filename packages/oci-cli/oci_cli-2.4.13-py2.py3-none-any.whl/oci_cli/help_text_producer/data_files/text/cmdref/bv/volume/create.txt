create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new volume in the specified compartment. Volumes can be
created in sizes ranging from 50 GB (51200 MB) to 16 TB (16777216 MB),
in 1 GB (1024 MB) increments. By default, volumes are 1 TB (1048576
MB). For general information about block volumes, see Overview of
Block Volume Service.

A volume and instance can be in separate compartments but must be in
the same Availability Domain. For information about access control and
compartments, see Overview of the IAM Service. For information about
Availability Domains, see Regions and Availability Domains. To get a
list of Availability Domains, use the *ListAvailabilityDomains*
operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the volume, which is
simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique,
and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
