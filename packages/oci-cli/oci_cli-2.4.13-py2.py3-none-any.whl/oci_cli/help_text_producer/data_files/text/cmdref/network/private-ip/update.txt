update
******


Description
===========

Updates the specified private IP. You must specify the object's OCID.
Use this operation if you want to:

    - Change the display name for a secondary private IP. - Change
   the hostname for a secondary private IP.

To move a secondary private IP to another VNIC, use the *bcms network
vnic assign-private-ip* command with the --unassign-if-already-
assigned switch.

This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs. To update the
hostname for the primary IP on a VNIC, use UpdateVnic.
