delete
******


Description
===========

Deletes the specified set of DHCP options, but only if it's not
associated with a subnet. You can't delete a VCN's default set of DHCP
options.

This is an asynchronous operation. The state of the set of options
will switch to TERMINATING temporarily until the set is completely
removed.


Usage
=====

   oci network dhcp-options delete [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--dhcp-id [text]
----------------

The OCID for the set of DHCP options. [required]


--if-match [text]
-----------------

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.


--force
-------

Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used


-?, -h, --help
--------------

Show this message and exit.
