create
******


Description
===========

Creates a boot disk image for the specified instance or imports an
exported image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage
service.

When creating a new image, you must provide the OCID of the instance
you want to use as the basis for the image, and the OCID of the
compartment containing that instance. For more information about
images, see Managing Custom Images.

When importing an exported image from Object Storage, you specify the
source information in ImageSourceDetails.

When importing an image based on the namespace, bucket name, and
object name, use ImageSourceViaObjectStorageTupleDetails.

When importing an image based on the Object Storage URL, use
ImageSourceViaObjectStorageUriDetails. See Object Storage URLs and
pre-authenticated requests for constructing URLs for image
import/export.

For more information about importing exported images, see Image
Import/Export.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the image, which is
simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique,
and you can change it. See UpdateImage. Avoid entering confidential
information.

Details for creating an image through import This is a complex type
whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string
on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

Example: '{ "objectName": "image-to-import.qcow2", "bucketName":
"MyBucket", "namespaceName": "MyNamespace", "sourceType":
"objectStorageTuple" }'

or

'{ "sourceUri": "https://objectstorage.us-
phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/n/MyNamespace/b/MyBucket/o/image-to-
import.qcow2", "sourceType": "objectStorageUri" }'


--instance-id [text]
--------------------

The OCID of the instance you want to use as the basis for the image.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
