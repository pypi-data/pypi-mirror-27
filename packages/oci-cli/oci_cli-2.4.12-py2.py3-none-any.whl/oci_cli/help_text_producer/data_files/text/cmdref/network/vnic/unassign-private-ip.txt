unassign-private-ip
*******************


Description
===========

Unassigns a secondary private IP address from a VNIC. After the IP
address is unassigned, you can assign to another VNIC in the subnet.

This operation cannot be used with primary private IPs, which are
automatically unassigned, and then deleted when the VNIC is
terminated.

For more information about secondary private IPs, see Managing IP
Addresses
