create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new route table for the specified VCN. In the request you
must also include at least one route rule for the new route table. For
information on the number of rules you can have in a route table, see
Service Limits. For general information about route tables in your VCN
and the types of targets you can use in route rules, see Route Tables.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the route table to reside. Notice that the
route table doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN,
subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure
which compartment to use, put the route table in the same compartment
as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access
control, see Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs,
see Resource Identifiers.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the route table,
otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and
you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.


Usage
=====

   oci network route-table create [OPTIONS]


Options
=======


--compartment-id, -c [text]
---------------------------

The OCID of the compartment to contain the route table. [required]


--route-rules [complex type]
----------------------------

The collection of rules used for routing destination IPs to network
devices. [required] This is a complex type whose value must be valid
JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or
passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The --generate-param-json-input option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

Example: '[{"cidrBlock":"0.0.0.0/0","networkEntityId":"ocid1.internet
gateway.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaxtfqb2srw7hoi5cmdum4n6ow2xm2zhrzqqypmlteiiebt
mvl75ya"}]'


--vcn-id [text]
---------------

The OCID of the VCN the route table belongs to. [required]


--display-name [text]
---------------------

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.


--generate-full-command-json-input
----------------------------------

Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that
can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]
----------------------------------

Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
