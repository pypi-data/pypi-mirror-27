from-object-uri
***************


Description
===========

Imports an exported image from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object
Storage Service using the Object Storage Service URL to identify the
location to import from.

For more information about importing exported images, see Image
Import/Export.

See Object Storage URLs and pre-authenticated requests for
constructing URLs for image import/export.

You may optionally specify a display name for the image, which is
simply a friendly name or description. It does not have to be unique,
and you can change it. See UpdateImage. Avoid entering confidential
information.

--generate-full-command-json-input

can be provided to this command.

This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the
appropriate option values, and then passed back via the --from-json
option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the
command line.


--generate-param-json-input [text]

When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will
print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.


--from-json [text]
------------------

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used
