create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new Internet Gateway for the specified VCN. For more
information, see Connectivity to the Internet.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the Internet Gateway to reside. Notice that
the Internet Gateway doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the
VCN or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which
compartment to use, put the Internet Gateway in the same compartment
with the VCN. For more information about compartments and access
control, see Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs,
see Resource Identifiers.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the Internet Gateway,
otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and
you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

For traffic to flow between a subnet and an Internet Gateway, you must
create a route rule accordingly in the subnet's route table (for
example, 0.0.0.0/0 > Internet Gateway). See UpdateRouteTable.

You must specify whether the Internet Gateway is enabled when you
create it. If it's disabled, that means no traffic will flow to/from
the internet even if there's a route rule that enables that traffic.
You can later use UpdateInternetGateway to easily disable/enable the
gateway without changing the route rule.
