.SS \-\-public\-access\-type [NoPublicAccess|ObjectRead]
.sp
The type of public access available on this bucket. Allows authenticated caller to access the bucket or contents of this bucket. By default a bucket is set to NoPublicAccess. It is treated as NoPublicAccess when this value is not specified. When the type is NoPublicAccess the bucket does not allow any public access. When the type is ObjectRead the bucket allows public access to the GetObject operation only.
.SS \-\-storage\-tier [Standard|Archive]
.sp
The type of storage tier for this bucket. A bucket is set to Standard tier by default, which means the bucket will be put in the standard storage tier. When the Archive tier type is set explicitly, the bucket is put in the Archive Storage tier. The storage\-tier property is immutable after bucket is created.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
