.sp
The OCID of the compartment. [required]
.SS \-\-start\-time [datetime]
.sp
Returns events that were processed at or after this start date and time, expressed in \fI\%RFC 3339\fP <\fBhttps://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt\fP> timestamp format. For example, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-15T11:30:00Z\fP will retrieve a list of all events processed since 30 minutes after the 11th hour of January 15, 2017, in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You can specify a value with granularity to the minute. Seconds (and milliseconds, if included) must be set to \fI0\fP\&. [required]
.SS \-\-end\-time [datetime]
.sp
Returns events that were processed before this end date and time, expressed in \fI\%RFC 3339\fP <\fBhttps://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt\fP> timestamp format. For example, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\fP and an end value of \fI2017\-01\-02T00:00:00Z\fP will retrieve a list of all events processed on January 1, 2017. Similarly, a start value of \fI2017\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\fP and an end value of \fI2017\-02\-01T00:00:00Z\fP will result in a list of all events processed between January 1, 2017 and January 31, 2017.
