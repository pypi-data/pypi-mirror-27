.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new route table for the specified VCN. In the request you must also include at least one route rule for the new route table. For information on the number of rules you can have in a route table, see \fI\%Service Limits\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/servicelimits.htm\fP>\&. For general information about route tables in your VCN and the types of targets you can use in route rules, see \fI\%Route Tables\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the route table to reside. Notice that the route table doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, subnets, or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the route table in the same compartment as the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the route table, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.sp
The OCID of the compartment to contain the route table. [required]
.SS \-\-route\-rules [complex type]
.sp
The collection of rules used for routing destination IPs to network devices. [required]
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.sp
Example: \(aq[{"cidrBlock":"0.0.0.0/0","networkEntityId":"ocid1.internetgateway.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaaxtfqb2srw7hoi5cmdum4n6ow2xm2zhrzqqypmlteiiebtmvl75ya"}]\(aq
.SS \-\-vcn\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the VCN the route table belongs to. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.sp
Prints out a JSON document which represents all possible options that can be provided to this command.
.sp
This JSON document can be saved to a file, modified with the appropriate option values, and then passed back via the \-\-from\-json option. This provides an alternative to typing options out on the command line.
.SS \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input [text]
.sp
Complex input, such as arrays and objects, are passed in JSON format.
.sp
When passed the name of an option which takes complex input, this will print out example JSON of what needs to be passed to that option.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used
