# Catena

Catena simplifies the deployment and usage of private blockchains on cloud platforms.

It handles:

- Configuration of blockchains
- Adding/removing blockchain nodes
- Secure storage of the node ssh keys
- Dashboards and monitoring
- Connectivity to tools and other blockchains

# Catena UI

A text based prototype of the UI is available on [github](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Catena-UI).

# Getting started

Unfortunately there isn't much documentation at the moment. We are working hard on it - please check again in a couple of days.

In the meantime you can find more information in our [wiki](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Catena/wiki) or watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqEbBTfvFZ4) of our presentation at the OpenStack Summit.
