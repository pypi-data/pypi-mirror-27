=========

0.10.0 ()
------------------

* Improved unit management by adding a unit/basis for both the
  adsorbent (ex: amount adsorbed per g, kg or cm3 of material
  are all valid) and loading (ex: mmol, g, kg of gas adsorbed
  per amount of material are all valid)
* Separated isotherm models so that they can now be easily
  created by the used.
* Added new isotherm models: Toth, Jensen-Seaton, W-VST, FH-VST.
* Made creation of classes (Adsorbate/Sample/Isotherms) more
  intuitive.

0.9.3 (2017-10-24)
------------------

  although they currently do not have any influence on data processing

------------------

* Slightly changed json format for efficiency
