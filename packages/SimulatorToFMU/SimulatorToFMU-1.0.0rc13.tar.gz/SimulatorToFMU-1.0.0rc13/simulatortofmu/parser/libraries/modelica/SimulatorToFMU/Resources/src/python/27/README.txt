This directory contains the source files
that are used to build the Python API
for the SimulatorToFMU library.
To compile the files on Linux Ubuntu,
the package python-dev needs to be installed.

The makefile generates libraries for the respective
operating system, and copies the library to
SimulatorToFMU.Resources/Library/"operatingSystem".
