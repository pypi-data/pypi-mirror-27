# mklibpy: A simple Python library

Author: [Michael Kim](http://michaelkim0407.com) <mkim0407@gmail.com>

## Installation

There are several ways to install this package. Please choose the one that fits you the best.

* Install using pip (recommended)

    Please refer to https://packaging.python.org if you have troubles.

        $ pip install mklibpy

    You will probably need sudo privileges if you are installing on Linux/Mac.

    This method is recommended because it is very easy to update:

        $ pip install -U mklibpy

* Install source code

1. Install as a library

    If you cannot / do not want to use pip, you can directly download the source code of this package.

    Only the `mklibpy` folder is needed.

    Unpack the folder anywhere you like, and add the directory (the one containing the `mklibpy` folder) to `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

2. Install into a single project (not recommended)

    If you only want this package for a single project, you can unpack the `mklibpy` folder in the source root of your project.
