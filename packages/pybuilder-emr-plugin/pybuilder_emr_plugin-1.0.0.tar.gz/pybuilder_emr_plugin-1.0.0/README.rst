====================
pybuilder_emr_plugin
====================

PyBuilder plugin to simplify building projects for Amazon EMR. The
following use cases are supported:

* Packaging Python code for EMR_ and uploading the result to S3_.

This project is based heavily on pybuilder_aws_plugin_ by Immobilienscout.

.. _EMR: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/emr/
.. _S3: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/
.. _pybuilder_aws_plugin: https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/pybuilder_aws_plugin

Usage
=====================

Add the following plugin dependency to your ``build.py`` (will install directly
from PyPi and require the install_dependencies plugin):

.. code:: python

    use_plugin('python.install_dependencies')
    use_plugin('pypi:pybuilder_emr_plugin')

After this you have the following additional tasks, which are explained below:

* ``emr_package``
* ``emr_upload_to_s3``
* ``emr_release``

@Task: emr_package
--------------------------
This task assembles the Zip-file (a.k.a. the *emr-zip*) which will be
uploaded to S3_ with the task ``emr_upload_to_s3``. The files are assembled using
a directory *$target/emr-release*. This task consists of the following steps:

Add all dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install every entry in ``build.py``, that is specified by using
``project.depends_on()``, into a temporary directory via ``pip install -t``.
These will be included in the resulting emr-zip. Set the project property
``install_dependencies_index_url`` to use a custom index url (e.g. an internal
`PYPI server`__).

**Note:** This excludes `boto`, `boto3` and `pyspark` as they are included in `AWS EMR dependencies`__ by default

.. __: http://doc.devpi.net/latest/

Add all own modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All modules which are found in ``src/main/python/`` are copied directly into
the lambda-zip.

Add all resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All files which are found in ``src/main/resources/`` are copied directly into
the lambda-zip.

Copy all script files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The content of the scripts folder (``src/main/scripts``) in a PyBuilder project
is normally intended to be placed in ``/usr/bin``. This plugin assumes this
directory contains scripts which are used as *main.py* argument to *spark-submit*,
therefore they are copied to the release directory and will be copied
to S3_ with the task ``emr_upload_to_s3``. They are not part of the *emr-zip*

Pack everything into the Zip-file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All these files are packed as a Zip-file, except the script files

@Task: emr_upload_to_s3
-----------------------
This task uploads the generated zip and all script files to an S3_ bucket. The bucket name is set in
``build.py``:

.. code:: python

    project.set_property('emr.s3.bucket-name', 'my_emr_bucket')

The default acl for zips to be uploaded is ``bucket-owner-full-control``. But
if you need another acl you can overwrite this as follows in ``build.py``:

.. code:: python

    project.set_property('emr.s3.file-access-control', '<acl>')

.. _acl:

Possible acl values are:

* ``private``
* ``public-read``
* ``public-read-write``
* ``authenticated-read``
* ``bucket-owner-read``
* ``bucket-owner-full-control``

Furthermore, the plugin assumes that you already have a shell with enabled AWS
access (exported keys or .boto or ...).

The uploaded files will be placed in a directory with the version number like:
``v123/projectname.zip`` and ``v123/main.py``.

Use the property ``bucket_prefix`` to add a prefix to the uploaded
files. For example:

.. code:: python

   project.set_property('emr.s3.bucket-prefix', 'my_emr/')

This will upload the zip-file to the following key:
``my_emr/v123/projectname.zip``

@Task: emr_release
-----------------------------------

These tasks copy the emr-zip and script files from the versioned path
to version independant path named ``latest``. For Example:

- ``my_emr/v123/my-project.zip`` is copied to ``my_emr/latest/my-project.zip``

This provides a simple release mechanism that follows the "latest greatest"
principle. Users can rely on the files under ``latest`` to be the latest tested
version.

Use the property ``emr.s3.release-prefix`` to modify your release prefix. For example:

.. code:: python

   project.set_property('emr.s3.release-prefix', 'LATEST/')
