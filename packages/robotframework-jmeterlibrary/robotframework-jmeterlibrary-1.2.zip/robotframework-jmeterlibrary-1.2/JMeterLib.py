This library provides simple way to integrate Robot Framework and JMeter. JTL output
files can be analysed and converted to HTML, Python dictionary or SQLite format.

Version 1.2 released on 29th of December 2017.

What's new:

- adapted to new csv log format

Following software versions were used during development:
- Python-2.7.14
- robotframework-3.0.2
- robotframework-ride-1.5.2.1
- jmeter 2.12
- jmeter 3.3

Installation:
- run command: pip install robotframework-jmeterlibrary

OR
- download, unzip and run command: python setup.py install

Example for running JMeter and parsing results in single keyword:
 | run jmeter analyse jtl convert | D:/apache-jmeter-2.12/bin/jmeter.bat | D:/Tests/Test1Thread1Loop.jmx | D:/Tests/output1.jtl |

Example for running JMeter and parsing results in separate keyword:
| ${logPath}= | set variable | D:/Tests/output1.jtl |  |
| run jmeter | D:/apache-jmeter-2.12/bin/jmeter.bat | D:/Tests/Test1Thread1Loop.jmx | ${logPath} |
| analyse jtl convert | ${logPath} |  |  |

Example for reading parsed contents:
| ${result} | analyse jtl convert | ${logPath} |  |
| log | ${result} |  |  |
| : FOR | ${ELEMENT} | IN |	@{result} |
|  | log dictionary	| ${ELEMENT} |  |
