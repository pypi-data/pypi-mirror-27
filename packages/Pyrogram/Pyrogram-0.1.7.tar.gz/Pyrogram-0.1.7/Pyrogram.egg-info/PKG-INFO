        Overview
        ========
        
        **Pyrogram** is a Client Library written from the ground up in Python, designed
        for Python application developers. It offers simple and complete access to the
        `Telegram Messenger API`_. Pyrogram:
        
        -   Provides idiomatic, developer-friendly Python code (either generated or
            hand-written) making the Telegram API simple to use.
        
        -   Handles all the low-level details of communication with the Telegram servers
            by implementing the `MTProto Mobile Protocol v2.0`_.
        
        -   Makes use of the latest Telegram API version (`Layer 73`_).
        
        -   Can be easily installed and upgraded using ``pip``.
        
        -   Requires a minimal set of dependencies.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        -   Operating systems:
        
            -   Linux
        
            -   macOS
        
            -   Windows
        
        -   Python 3.3 or higher.
        
        -   A Telegram API key.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install and upgrade the library using standard Python tools:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install --upgrade pyrogram
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        The `Wiki`_ contains all the information needed to get you started with Pyrogram:
        
        -   `Getting Started`_
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        The library is still in its early stages, thus lots of functionalities aiming to
        make working with Telegram's API easy are yet to be added and documented.
        
        However, being the core functionalities already implemented, every Telegram API
        method listed in the API scheme can be used right away; the goal is therefore to
        build a powerful, simple to use, `bot-like`_ interface on top of those low-level
        functions.
        
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        Soon. For now, have a look at the ``pyrogram.Client`` code to get some insights.
        
        Currently you are able to easily:
        
        -   ``send_message``
        
        -   ``forward_messages``
        
        -   ``edit_message_text``
        
        -   ``delete_messages``
        
        -   ``send_chat_action``
        
        -   Some more...
        
        as well as listening for updates and catching API errors.
