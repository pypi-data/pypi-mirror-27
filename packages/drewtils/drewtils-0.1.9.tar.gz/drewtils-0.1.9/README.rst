A collection of utilities that I frequently use.

Installation
------------

Install with ``pip`` with ```pip install drewtils``` or through github by
cloning the repository and running ``python setup.py install``

Verify your installation by running ``python setup.py test``.
All tests should pass if the installation completed and the master build is passing.
