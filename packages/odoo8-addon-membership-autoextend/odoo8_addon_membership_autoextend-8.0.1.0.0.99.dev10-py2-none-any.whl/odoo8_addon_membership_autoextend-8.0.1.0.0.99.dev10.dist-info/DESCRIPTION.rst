=====================
Autoextend membership
=====================

This module was written to define membership products as being autoextended.

Members with a membership of this type will be informed before an extension takes place in order to give them the chance to cancel their membership.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* go to a membership product
* check box ``Autoextend membership``
* optionally set email templates to inform a member about an upcoming extension and after it's done
* optionally set an amount of days before the extension the warning mail should be sent
* if you select an extension membership, this product will be used to extend the membership. Otherwise, the current membership product will be used

Note that this module is not strictly necessary for automatic extensions, you can have the same effect with the modules ``subscription`` and ``membership_variable_period``.
