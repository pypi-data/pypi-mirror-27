    On Windows, I did not check on Linux,
    the short cut ``jupyter-notebook.exe`` is not present
    in the virtual environment. Here is a simple python
    program to launch the notebook server from
    the virtual environement.

    ::

        import os
        import sys
        ndir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "folder_for_notebooks"))
        sys.argv = [sys.argv[0], "--notebook-dir=%s" % ndir]
        from notebook import notebookapp as app
        app.launch_new_instance()

    And then::

        python -u your_launch.py
