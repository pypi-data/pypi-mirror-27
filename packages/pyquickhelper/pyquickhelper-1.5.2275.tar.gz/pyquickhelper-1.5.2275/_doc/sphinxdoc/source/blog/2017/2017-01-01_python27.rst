    Support for Python 2.7 will be discontinued.
    Too much work. No update on pypi for this version.
    To install it from the source:

    ::

        <path_to_python3> setup.py copy27
        cd dist_module27
        <path_to_python2> setup.py install

    Everything is not working under python 2.
