    It took me some time to do the migration to IPython 3.1.
    The code which automatically generates the documentation
    had to be updated to follow the new format of the notebooks.
    I had to redo the configuration of ipython
    to have the graph inline...
    I hope ipython does not rename itself into
    `jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
    The design is better but the notebooks crash from time to time.
    I guess the code becomes better each time a migration happens.
    But it takes quite some time.
    However, the changes are not reversible. Ipython needs to be updated
    otherwise the automated generation of the documentation will not work.
    For Jenkins, just remind that the server needs your credentials
    othewise it does not easily find
    `pandoc <http://pandoc.org/>`_.
