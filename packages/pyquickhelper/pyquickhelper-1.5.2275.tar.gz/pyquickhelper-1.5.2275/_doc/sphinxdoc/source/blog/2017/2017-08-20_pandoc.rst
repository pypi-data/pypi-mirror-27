    I was using the `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about>`_
    to test a module with Linux. I could not make it work
    due to an old version of :epkg:`pandoc`.
    Surprisingly, the default ``apt-get install pandoc`` installed
    a very old version (1.12). I could not convert any notebook
    with `nbconvert <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert>`_ into latex.
    I finally installed the latest version (1.19) and it worked perfectly.
    You can see the installation step in file
    `.circleci/config.yml <https://github.com/sdpython/pyquickhelper/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml>`_.
    That was not the last issue because
    *pandoc* seems to be very slow on WSL.
    About that, you can read:
    `massive delay to call pandoc using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Bash for Windows <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/3448>`_,
    `stack ghc painfully slow <https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/1671>`_.
