    Issue `6839 <https://bugs.python.org/issue6839>`_ happens when
    a zip file is created on Windows. The created zip may contain
    full path with ``\\`` when the file list only contains ``/``.
    This raises exception ``BadZipFile`` with the following message:
    *File name in directory ... and header ... differ* due to a mismatch
    between backslashes. Another consequence found on GitHub:
    `zipfile raises: File name in directory X and header Y differ. <https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso/issues/943>`_.
    The class :class:`WinZipFile <pyquickhelper.filehelper.winzipfile.WinZipFile>`
    owerwrites method :epkg:`*py:zipfile:ZipFile:open`
    to fix the line which checks that names are consistent in the file list
    and in the compressed content.
