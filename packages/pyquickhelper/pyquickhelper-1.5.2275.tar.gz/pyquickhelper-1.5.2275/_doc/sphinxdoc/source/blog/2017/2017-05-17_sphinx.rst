    `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_
    has released a new version 1.6.1 but it breaks a couple of
    packages.
    `sphinx_gallery <https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    breaks with the following error:

    ::

          File "python\lib\site-packages\sphinx_gallery\gen_gallery.py", line 297, in setup
            if 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' in app._extensions:
        AttributeError: 'Sphinx' object has no attribute '_extensions'

    This is probably going to be fixed anytime soon. In the meantime,
    you can just avoid updating Sphinx or modify the code of
    this package by removing the test.
    `sphinxcontrib.images <https://github.com/spinus/sphinxcontrib-images>`_
    also breaks. I recommand to postpone the update:

    ::

        pip install sphinx==1.5.6

    *pyquickhelper* should work with both when the images
    packages will be updated.
