    File ``setup.py`` usually defines something like:

    ::

         setup(
                # ...
                packages=packages,
                package_dir=package_dir,
                # ...
                package_data=package_data,
                # ...
                )

    You need to be careful on Windows because the setup
    is case sensitive. So, if you don't see any file in your setup,
    don't forget that.
