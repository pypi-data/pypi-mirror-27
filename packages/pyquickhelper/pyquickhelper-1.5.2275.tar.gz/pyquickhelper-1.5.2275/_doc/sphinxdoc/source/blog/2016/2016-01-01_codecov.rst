    *pyquickhelper* is using :epkg:`coverage`
    to measure the coverage of the unit tests.
    `coveralls <https://coveralls.io/>`_ cannot ingest these reports
    when :epkg:`codecov` does with a simple command line such as::

        codecov --token=69193a28-dc79-4a24-98ed-aedf441a8249
                --file=D:\jenkins\pymy\_pyquickhelper\_doc\sphinxdoc\source\coverage\coverage_report.xml
                --commit=f30c095f5da096e5db2ba6e5e0f7e07e833a8c81

    It is provided by module :epkg:`codecov`
    (or `github/codecov <https://github.com/codecov/codecov-python>`_).
    The coverage report is also available at
    `pyquickhelper coverage <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/coverage/index.html>`_.
    but these kinds of website keep track of the changes. Others available websites
    which provide badges are mentioned on the main page
    :epkg:`pyquickhelper`.
