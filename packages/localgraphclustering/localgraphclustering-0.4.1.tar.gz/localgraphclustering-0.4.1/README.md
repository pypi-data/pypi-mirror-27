# Local Graph Clustering

Local Graph Clustering provides

- methods that find local clusters in a given graph without touching the whole graph
- methods that improve a given cluster
- methods for global graph partitioning
- tools to compute [Network Community Profiles](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427951.2009.10129177)

The current version is 0.4.1 and it is appropriate for experts and intermediates. Contact information for any questions and feedback is given below.

## Installation

```
Clone the repo
```
```
Enter the folder using the termimal
```
```
Type in the terminal `python setup.py install`
```
Note that this package runs only with Python 3.

It can also be installed through pip:

```
pip3 install localgraphclustering
```

## Import from Julia

1. In Julia, add the PyCall package: 
   
   `Pkg.add(PyCall)`
2. Update which version of Python that PyCall defaults to:

    `ENV["PYTHON"] = (path to python3 executable) `

    `Pkg.build("PyCall")`

    (You can get the path to the python3 executable by just running "which python3" in the terminal.)
3. Make sure the PyPlot package is added in Julia.â€¨
4. Import *localgraphclustering* by using:

   `using PyPlot`

   `@pyimport localgraphclustering`

You can now use any routine in *localgraphluserting* from Julia.

## Examples

All examples are in the [notebooks](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/tree/master/notebooks) folder.

Below is a simple demonstration from [test.py](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/blob/master/notebooks/test.py) in [notebooks](https://github.com/kfoynt/LocalGraphClustering/tree/master/notebooks) on how to improve spectral partitioning using flow-based methods from local graph clustering.

```python
from localgraphclustering import *

import time
import numpy as np

# Read graph. This also supports gml and graphml format.
g = graph_class_local.GraphLocal('./datasets/senate.edgelist','edgelist',' ')

# Create an object for global spectral partitioning
sp = spectral_partitioning.Spectral_partitioning()

# Call the global spectral partitioning algorithm.
output_sp = sp.produce([g])

# Only one input graph is given, i.e., [g].
# Extract the array from position 0 and store it.
eig2 = output_sp[0]

# Create an object for the sweep cut rounding procedure.
sc = sweepCut_general.SweepCut_general()

# Round the eigenvector
output_sc = sc.produce([g],p=eig2)

# Extract the partition for g and store it.
eig2_rounded = output_sc[0][0]

# Create an object for subgraph node partitioning.
SL_fast = SimpleLocal_fast.SimpleLocal_fast()

# Conductance before improvement
print("Conductance before improvement:",g.compute_conductance(eig2_rounded))

# Start calling SimpleLocal
start = time.time()
output_SL_fast = SL_fast.produce([g],[eig2_rounded])
end = time.time()
print("running time:",str(end-start)+"s")

# Conductance after improvement
print("Conductance after improvement:",g.compute_conductance(output_SL_fast[0][0]))

output_SL = output_SL_fast[0][0]
```
