Description: # Terraform 2 SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/westpac-cloud-engineering/Terraform-Enterprise-2-Python-SDK.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/westpac-cloud-engineering/Terraform-Enterprise-2-Python-SDK) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/westpac-cloud-engineering/Terraform-Enterprise-2-Python-SDK/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/westpac-cloud-engineering/Terraform-Enterprise-2-Python-SDK) 
        
        SDK to call Terraform Enterprise 2 using Python.
        
        This SDK was developed to wrap Restful API calls to Terraform Enterprise 2, in order to trigger Plans, Applys and Variable updates using Jenkins. 
        
        ## How to install
        
        ```
        pip install te2_sdk
        ```
        
        ## Triggering a Run
        Below is an example of how you trigger a plan
        
        ```python
        from te2_sdk import te2
        
        client = te2.TE2Client(
            organisation="MY_TERRAFORM_ENTERPRISE_ORG",
            atlas_token="SECRET_TOKEN_HERE",
            base_url="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/api/v2" # Change this if you are using a private install
        )
        
        ws_runs = te2.TE2WorkspaceRuns(client=client, workspace_name="My Workspace Name" )
        run = ws_runs.request_run(request_type="plan", destroy=False)
        
        ```
        
        And to do a run:
        ```python
        run = ws_runs.request_run(request_type="apply", destroy=False, run_id = "RUN_ID_FROM_PLAN")
        ```
