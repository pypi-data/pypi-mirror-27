Description: Flask-Modus3
        =====================
        This is the same flask_modus as done by Rhys Elsmore with a slight change by Chaim Finkelman to make it work with both python 3.6 and 2.7 .

        Enable Flask Method overrides via Query String and Headers.
        
        Allows for a much more enjoyable experience when building HTML which requires a custom method, or when using a client that doesn't support certain methods.
        
        The following methods are supported:
        
            - Get
            - Post
            - Put
            - Patch
            - Delete
            - Options
            - Head
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is very straightforward::
        
            pip install flask-modus3
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Configuration is pretty damn easy::
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask_modus3 import Modus
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            modus = Modus(app)
        
        *or*::
        
            from flask import Flask
            from flask_modus3 import Modus
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
            modus = Modus()
            modus.init_app(app)
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Either append your favoured methods to the end of your query string::
        
            $ curl http://localhost:5000/?_method=put
        
        or supply a X-HTTP-Method-Override header::
        
            $ curl -H "X-HTTP-Method-Override: PUT" http://localhost:5000/
        
        *Note:* If you supply both a header and a query string parameter, the method specified in the header will be that which is used.
