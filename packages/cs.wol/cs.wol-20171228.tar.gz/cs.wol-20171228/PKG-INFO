Description: Every WOL tool I have seen takes IP addresses and (a) infers the
        outbound NIC from the routing table (directly or naively) and (b)
        does not provide control for specifying the outbound NIC. I needed
        a tool to wake devices on a specific NIC, which do not have IP
        addresses, or do not have known IP addresses.
