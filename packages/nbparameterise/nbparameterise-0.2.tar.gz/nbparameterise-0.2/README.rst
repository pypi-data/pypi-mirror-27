Choose input values for a notebook, and nbparameterise will run it and render to HTML

*Experimental code*

To use it, create a notebook, where the first code cell contains simple variable
assignments of strings, numbers and booleans. Other cells after this should
do computation based on these values, and display the results. See 'Stock display'
for an example.

See the ``examples`` directory for some code using nbparameterise.

Nbparameterise is written in Python 3, but it can handle notebooks that use
Python 2.
