        =====
        
        SSMais is a Django application that aims to perform reservation management of a service over the Web.
        The main purpose of this application is to allow the reuse of features that are generally used in scheduling
        software such as scheduling, searching and registering services.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "ssmais" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'ssmais.search_scheduling',
            ]
        
        2. Include the ssmais URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^ssmais/', include('ssmais.urls')),
        
        3. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to create the ssmais models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a ssmais (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
