 Introduction

The aim of CodeReview is to provide tools for code review tasks on local Git repositories.  As
opposite to software like `Gerrit <https://www.gerritcodereview.com>`_ for example, CodeReview is
not designed to perform code review at a team level, but to check the stage before a commit and show
the difference between two versions.  In particular, CodeReview fills the gap with IDEs that don't
provide efficiently these features.
