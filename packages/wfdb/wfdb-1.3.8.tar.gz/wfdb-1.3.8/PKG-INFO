        Objects
        ~~~~~~~
        
        As of version 1.0.0, wfdb records are stored in **Record** or **MultiRecord** objects, and annotations are stored in **Annotation** objects. To see all attributes of an object, call `object.__dict__`
        
        
        **Record** - The class representing WFDB headers, and single segment WFDB records.
        
        Record objects can be created using the constructor, by reading a WFDB header
        with 'rdheader', or a WFDB record (header and associated dat files) with rdsamp'
        or 'srdsamp'.
        
        The attributes of the Record object give information about the record as specified
        by https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/header-5.htm
        
        In addition, the d_signals and p_signals attributes store the digital and physical
        signals of WFDB records with at least one channel.
        
        Contructor function:
        ::
        
            def __init__(self, p_signals=None, d_signals=None,
                         recordname=None, nsig=None,
                         fs=None, counterfreq=None, basecounter=None,
                         siglen=None, basetime=None, basedate=None,
                         filename=None, fmt=None, sampsperframe=None,
                         skew=None, byteoffset=None, adcgain=None,
                         baseline=None, units=None, adcres=None,
                         adczero=None, initvalue=None, checksum=None,
                         blocksize=None, signame=None, comments=None)
        
        Example Usage:
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            record1 = wfdb.Record(recordname='r1', fs=250, nsig=2, siglen=1000,
                                  filename=['r1.dat','r1.dat'])
        
        
        **MultiRecord** - The class representing multi-segment WFDB records.
        
        MultiRecord objects can be created using the constructor, or by reading a multi-segment
        WFDB record using 'rdsamp' with the 'm2s' (multi to single) input parameter set to False.
        
        The attributes of the MultiRecord object give information about the entire record as specified
        by https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/header-5.htm
        
        In addition, the 'segments' parameter is a list of Record objects representing each
        individual segment, or 'None' representing empty segments, of the entire multi-segment record.
        
        Noteably, this class has no attribute representing the signals as a whole. The 'multi_to_single'
        instance method can be called on MultiRecord objects to return a single segment representation
        of the record as a Record object. The resulting Record object will have its 'p_signals' field set.
        
        Contructor function:
        ::
        
            def __init__(self, segments = None, layout = None,
                         recordname=None, nsig=None, fs=None,
                         counterfreq=None, basecounter=None,
                         siglen=None, basetime=None, basedate=None,
                         segname = None, seglen = None, comments=None)
        
        Example Usage:
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            recordM = wfdb.MultiRecord(recordname='rm', fs=50, nsig=8, siglen=9999,
                                       segname=['rm_1', '~', rm_2'],
                                       seglen=[800, 200, 900])
        
            recordL = wfdb.rdsamp('s00001-2896-10-10-00-31', m2s = False)
            recordL = recordL.multi_to_single()
        
        
        **Annotation** - The class representing WFDB annotations.
        
        Annotation objects can be created using the constructor, or by reading a WFDB annotation
        file with 'rdann'.
        
        The attributes of the Annotation object give information about the annotation as specified
        by https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/annot-5.htm:
        
        - ``recordname``: The base file name (without extension) of the record that the annotation is attached to.
        - ``extension``: The file extension of the file the annotation is stored in.
        - ``sample``: The annotation locations in samples relative to the beginning of the record.
        - ``symbol``: The annotation type according the the standard WFDB codes.
        - ``subtype``: The marked class/category of each annotation.
        - ``chan``: The signal channel associated with each annotations.
        - ``num``: The labelled annotation number for each annotation.
        - ``aux_note``: The auxiliary information string for each annotation.
        - ``fs``: The sampling frequency of the record, if available.
        - ``label_store``: The integer value used to store/encode each annotation label
        - ``description``: The descriptive string of each annotation label
        - ``custom_labels``: The custom annotation labels defined in the annotation file.
          Maps the relationship between the three label fields.
          The data type is a pandas DataFrame with three columns: ['label_store', 'symbol', 'description']
        - ``contained_labels``: The unique labels contained in this annotation. Same structure
          as custom_labels.
        
        
        Constructor function:
        ::
            def __init__(self, recordname, extension, sample, symbol=None, subtype=None,
                         chan=None, num=None, aux_note=None, fs=None, label_store=None,
                         description=None, custom_labels=None, contained_labels=None)
        
        Call `showanncodes()` to see the list of standard annotation codes. Any text used to label annotations that are not one of these codes should go in the 'aux_note' field rather than the 'symbol' field.
        
        Example usage:
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            ann1 = wfdb.Annotation(recordname='ann1', annotator='atr', sample=[10,20,400],
                                   symbol = ['N','N','['], aux_note=[None, None, 'Serious Vfib'])
        
        Reading Signals
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        **rdsamp** - Read a WFDB record and return the signal and record descriptors as attributes in a Record or MultiRecord object.
        
        ::
        
            record = rdsamp(recordname, sampfrom=0, sampto=None, channels=None,
                            physical=True, pbdir = None, m2s=True)
        
        Example Usage:
        
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            ecgrecord = wfdb.rdsamp('sampledata/test01_00s', sampfrom=800, channels = [1,3])
        
        Input Arguments:
        
        -  ``recordname`` (required): The name of the WFDB record to be read (without any file extensions).

        **srdsamp** - A simplified wrapper function around rdsamp. Read a WFDB record and return the physical signal and a few important descriptor fields.
        
        ::
        
            signals, fields = srdsamp(recordname, sampfrom=0, sampto=None, channels=None, pbdir=None)
        
        Example Usage:
        
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            sig, fields = wfdb.srdsamp('sampledata/test01_00s', sampfrom=800, channels = [1,3])
        
        Input arguments:
        
        - ``recordname`` (required): The name of the WFDB record to be read (without any file extensions). If the argument contains any path delimiter characters, the argument will be interpreted as PATH/baserecord and the data files will be searched for in the local path.

        Converting between Analog and Digital Values
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When reading signal sample values into ``record`` objects using ``rdsamp``, the samples are stored in either the ``p_signals`` or the ``d_signals`` field depending on the specified return type (``physical`` = ``True`` or ``False`` respectively).
        
        One can also use existing objects to obtain physical values from digital values and vice versa, without having to re-read the wfdb file with a different set of options. The two following instance methods perform the conversions.
        
        
        **adc** - Performs analogue to digital conversion of the physical signal stored in p_signals if expanded is False, or e_p_signals if expanded is True. The p_signals/e_p_signals, fmt, gain, and baseline fields must all be valid. If inplace is True, the adc will be performed inplace on the variable, the d_signals/e_d_signals attribute will be set, and the p_signals/e_p_signals field will be set to None.
        
        ::
        
            record.adc(self, expanded=False, inplace=False)
        
        Input arguments:
        
        - ``expanded`` (default=False): Boolean specifying whether to transform the e_p_signals attribute (True) or the p_signals attribute (False).
        - ``inplace`` (default=False): Boolean specifying whether to automatically set the object's corresponding digital signal attribute and set the physical signal attribute to None (True), or to return the converted signal as a separate variable without changing the original physical signal attribute (False).
        
        Possible output argument:
        
        - ``d_signals``: The digital conversion of the signal. Either a 2d numpy array or a list of 1d numpy arrays.
        
        Example Usage:
                
        ::
        
          import wfdb
          record = wfdb.rdsamp('sampledata/100')
          d_signal = record.adc()
          record.adc(inplace=True)
          record.dac(inplace=True)
        
        
        **dac** - Performs digital to analogue conversion of the digital signal stored in d_signals if expanded is False, or e_d_signals if expanded is True. The d_signals/e_d_signals, fmt, gain, and baseline fields must all be valid. If inplace is True, the dac will be performed inplace on the variable, the p_signals/e_p_signals attribute will be set, and the d_signals/e_d_signals field will be set to None.
        
        ::
        
            record.dac(self, expanded=False, inplace=False)
        
        Input arguments:
        
        - ``expanded`` (default=False): Boolean specifying whether to transform the e_d_signals attribute (True) or the d_signals attribute (False).
        - ``inplace`` (default=False): Boolean specifying whether to automatically set the object's corresponding physical signal attribute and set the digital signal attribute to None (True), or to return the converted signal as a separate variable without changing the original digital signal attribute (False).
        
        Possible output argument:
        
        - ``p_signals``: The physical conversion of the signal. Either a 2d numpy array or a list of 1d numpy arrays.
        
        Example Usage:
                
        ::
        
          import wfdb
          record = wfdb.rdsamp('sampledata/100', physical=False)
          p_signal = record.dac()
          record.dac(inplace=True)
          record.adc(inplace=True)
        
        
        Writing Signals
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Record class has a **wrsamp** instance method for writing wfdb record files. Create a valid Record object and call ``record.wrsamp()``. If you choose this more advanced method, see also the `setdefaults`, `set_d_features`, and `set_p_features` instance methods to help populate attributes. In addition, there is also the following simpler module level **wrsamp** function.
        
        
        **wrsamp** - Write a single segment WFDB record, creating a WFDB header file and any associated dat files.
        
        ::
        
            wrsamp(recordname, fs, units, signames, p_signals=None, d_signals=None,
                   fmt=None, gain=None, baseline=None, comments=None, basetime=None,
                   basedate=None)
        
        Example Usage:
        
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            sig, fields = wfdb.srdsamp('a103l', sampfrom = 50000, channels = [0,1],
                                       pbdir = 'challenge/2015/training')
            wfdb.wrsamp('ecgrecord', fs = 250, units = ['mV', 'mV'],
                        signames = ['I', 'II'], p_signals = sig, fmt = ['16', '16'])
        
        Input Arguments:
        
        - ``recordname`` (required): The string name of the WFDB record to be written (without any file extensions).
        - ``fs`` (required): The numerical sampling frequency of the record.
        - ``units`` (required): A list of strings giving the units of each signal channel.
        - ``signames`` (required): A list of strings giving the signal name of each signal channel.
        - ``p_signals`` (default=None): An MxN 2d numpy array, where M is the signal length. Gives the physical signal
          values intended to be written. Either p_signals or d_signals must be set, but not both. If p_signals
          is set, this method will use it to perform analogue-digital conversion, writing the resultant digital
          values to the dat file(s). If fmt is set, gain and baseline must be set or unset together. If fmt is
          unset, gain and baseline must both be unset.
        - ``d_signals`` (default=None): An MxN 2d numpy array, where M is the signal length. Gives the digital signal
          values intended to be directly written to the dat file(s). The dtype must be an integer type. Either
          p_signals or d_signals must be set, but not both. In addition, if d_signals is set, fmt, gain and baseline
          must also all be set.
        - ``fmt`` (default=None): A list of strings giving the WFDB format of each file used to store each channel.
          Accepted formats are: "80","212","16","24", and "32". There are other WFDB formats but this library
          will not write (though it will read) those file types.
        - ``gain`` (default=None): A list of integers specifying the ADC gain.
        - ``baseline`` (default=None): A list of integers specifying the digital baseline.
        - ``comments`` (default-None): A list of string comments to be written to the header file.
        - ``basetime`` (default=None): A string of the record's start time in 24h HH:MM:SS(.ms) format.
        - ``basedate`` (default=None): A string of the record's start date in DD/MM/YYYY format.

            annotation = rdann(recordname, extension, sampfrom=0, sampto=None, shiftsamps=False,
                               pbdir=None, return_label_elements=['symbol'], summarize_labels=False)

        Input Arguments:
        
        - ``recordname`` (required): The record name of the WFDB annotation file. ie. for file `100.atr`, recordname='100'

          file '100.atr', extension='atr'
        - ``sampfrom`` (default=0): The minimum sample number for annotations to be returned.
        - ``sampto`` (default=None): The maximum sample number for annotations to be returned.
        - ``shiftsamps`` (default=False): Boolean flag that specifies whether to return the
          sample indices relative to 'sampfrom' (True), or sample 0 (False). Annotation files
          store exact sample locations.
        - ``pbdir`` (default=None): Option used to stream data from Physiobank. The Physiobank database 
          directory from which to find the required annotation file.
          eg. For record '100' in 'http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb', pbdir = 'mitdb'.
        - ``return_label_elements`` (default=['symbol']): The label elements that are to be returned
          from reading the annotation file. A list with at least one of the following: 'symbol',
          'label_store', 'description'.
        - ``summarize_labels`` (default=False): Assign a summary table of the set of annotation labels
          contained in the file to the 'contained_labels' attribute of the returned object.

        Writing Annotations
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The Annotation class has a **wrann** instance method for writing wfdb annotation files. Create a valid Annotation object and call ``annotation.wrsamp()``. In addition, there is also the following simpler module level **wrann** function.
        
        **wrann** - Write a WFDB annotation file.
        
        ::
        
            wrann(recordname, extension, sample, symbol=None, subtype=None, chan=None,
                  num=None, aux_note=None, label_store=None, fs=None, custom_labels=None)
        
        Example Usage:
        
        ::
        
            import wfdb
            annotation = wfdb.rdann('b001', 'atr', pbdir='cebsdb')
            wfdb.wrann('b001', 'cpy', annotation.sample, annotation.symbol)
        
        Input Arguments:
        
        - ``recordname`` (required): The string name of the WFDB record to be written (without any file extensions).
        - ``extension`` (required): The string annotation file extension.
        - ``sample`` (required): The annotation location in samples relative to the beginning of the record. Numpy array.
        - ``symbol`` (default=None): The symbols used to display the annotation labels. List or numpy array. If this field is present, 'label_store' must not be present.
        - ``subtype`` (default=None): The marked class/category of each annotation. Numpy array.
        - ``chan`` (default=None): The signal channel associated with each annotation. Numpy array.
        - ``num`` (default=None): The labelled annotation number of each annotation. Numpy array.
        - ``aux_note`` (default=None): The auxiliary information strings. List or numpy array.
        - ``label_store`` (default=None): The integer values used to store the annotation labels. Numpy array. If this field is present, 'symbol' must not be present.
        - ``fs`` (default=None): The numerical sampling frequency of the record to be written to the file.
        - ``custom_labels`` (default=None): The map of custom defined annotation labels used for this annotation, in addition to the standard WFDB annotation labels. The custom labels are defined by two or three fields:
        
          - The integer values used to store custom annotation labels in the file (optional)
          - Their short display symbols
          - Their long descriptions.
        
          This input argument may come in four formats:
        
          1. A pandas.DataFrame object with columns: ['label_store', 'symbol', 'description']
          2. A pandas.DataFrame object with columns: ['symbol', 'description']
             If this option is chosen, label_store values are automatically chosen.
          3. A list or tuple of tuple triplets, with triplet elements representing: (label_store, symbol, description).
          4. A list or tuple of tuple pairs, with pair elements representing: (symbol, description).
             If this option is chosen, label_store values are automatically chosen.
          
          If the 'label_store' field is given for this function, and 'custom_labels' is defined, 'custom_labels'
          must contain 'label_store' in its mapping. ie. it must come in format 1 or 3 above.
        
        \*\ **NOTE**: Each annotation stored in a WFDB annotation file contains a sample and a label field. All other fields may or may not be present. Therefore in order to save space, when writing additional string features such as 'aux_note' that are not present for every annotation, it is recommended to make the field a list, with empty indices set to None so that they are not written to the file.
