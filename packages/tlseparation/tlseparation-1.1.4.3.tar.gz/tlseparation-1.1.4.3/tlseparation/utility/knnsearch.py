    ----------

    -------

    distance: array
        Distances from each neighbor to each central point in 'pts'.

    """
    Function to create a set of nearest neighbors indices and their respective
    distances for a set of points. This function is a variation of
    set_nbrs_knn that sets a limit size for a block of points to query. This
    makes it less efficient in terms of processing time, but avoids running
    out of memory in cases of very dense/large arrays/queries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: array
        N-dimensional array to perform the knn search on.
    pts: array
        N-dimensional array to search for on the knn search.
    knn: int
        Number of nearest neighbors to search for.
    return_dist: boolean
        Option to return or not the distances of each neighbor.
    block_size: int
        Limit of points to query. The variable 'pts' will be subdivided in
        n blocks of size block_size to perform query.

    Returns
    -------
    indices: array
        Set of neighbors indices from 'arr' for each entry in 'pts'.
    distance: array
