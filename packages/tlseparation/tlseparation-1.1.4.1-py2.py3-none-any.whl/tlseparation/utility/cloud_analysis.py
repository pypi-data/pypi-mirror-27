    Function to calculate the optimum distance among neighboring points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr: array
        N-dimensional array (m x n) containing a set of parameters (n) over a
        set of observations (m).

        Number of nearest neighbors to search to constitue the local subset of
        points around each point in 'arr'.

    dist: float
        Optimal distance among neighboring points.
