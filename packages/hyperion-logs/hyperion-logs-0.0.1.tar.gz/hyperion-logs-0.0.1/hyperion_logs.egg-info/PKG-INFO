        Hyperion V0.0.1
        ===========
        
        Hyperion provides an intuitive and efficient way to store logs from python into AWS CloudWatch.
        Typical usage looks like this::
        
            #Create an alias for the package
            import hyperion
        
            #returns a logger with the cloud watch handler established.  The steam name should be unique to the application.
            log = hyperion.get_logger(stream_name="holy_grail_app",log_group='monty_python')
        
            additional parameters for get_logger(stream_name,log_group,default_level):
            stream_name = the unique stream that the logs will be inserted into. defaults to: test_stream
            log_group = the group of streams that are associated with your team. defaults to: test_group
            default_level = the default logging level ie: debug,info,warning,error,critical. defaults to: info
        
        
            #Any log functions or configurations can be done to the log object returned.
            log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
