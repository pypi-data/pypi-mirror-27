# relvalconsumer

`relvalconsumer` is a fedmsg consumer for creating Fedora release validation
test events. It replaces the old `relval nightly --if-needed` sub-command,
which was expected to be run nightly as a cron job. Like the old system, each
time a compose appears, it runs various checks to decide whether it should
create an event for the compose. It creates events for both nightly composes
and 'candidate' composes.

It should create a first nightly for the next release shortly after a release
goes out. From then until the release, it will create new nightly events
periodically. It will never create a nightly event fewer than three days after
the current event. Between three and fourteen days after the current event,
it will create a new event if certain packages have changed (these are defined
in the code). After fourteen days it will create an event as soon as a nightly
compose appears. It will create events for all candidate composes as soon as
they appear.

It should never create an event for a given release from a Rawhide compose
after that release branches, because at that point wikitcms will decide that
any notional event for a Rawhide compose would be for the release *two* after
the current stable release, and this script will create events only for the
release *one* after the current stable release.

Note that in production mode the consumer is configured to create events in
the production wiki and send announcement emails to the test@ mailing list.
So, really, only one person should ever have it running in production mode,
and that's probably me. Please don't run it in production mode unless you're
taking over my job or something.

The code was written with Python 3 in mind, but it turns out that verification
of fedmsg message signatures does not currently work in Python 3, so it should
be run under Python 2 for now.

## Requirements

Python libraries:

* [fedmsg](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedmsg)
* [fedfind](https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/fedfind)
* [wikitcms](https://pagure.io/fedora-qa/python-wikitcms)
* [mwclient](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient)

## Installation

Install the required external Python libraries, then use setuptools to
install, e.g.:

        python setup.py install

## Test and production modes

Two consumers are provided, a 'test' and a 'production' consumer. For 'test':

* The consumer listens for `dev` (not `prod`) messages
* The consumer does not validate message signatures
* The consumer creates events on the staging wiki (not production wiki)
* The announcement email is logged rather than being mailed out

In this mode it is fairly safe to play around with the consumer, and you can
use a tool like `fedmsg-dg-replay` to trigger event creation by replaying a
relevant fedmsg (which will show up with a `dev` topic rather than `prod`).

For 'production':

* The consumer listens for `prod` (not `dev`) messages
* The consumer validates message signatures
* **The consumer creates events on the production wiki**
* **The consumer sends email notifications to public mailing lists**

**PLEASE** do not enable the production consumer unless you're absolutely sure
it's your job to create the official events.

The fedmsg config keys for the consumers are `relvalconsumer.test.enabled`
and `relvalconsumer.prod.enabled` respectively.
