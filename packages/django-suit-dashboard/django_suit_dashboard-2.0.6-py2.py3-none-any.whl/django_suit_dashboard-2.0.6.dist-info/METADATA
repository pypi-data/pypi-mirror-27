=====================
Django Suit Dashboard
=====================



Create a dashboard within Django admin interface.

This application was originally designed to work within `Django Suit`_
(hence the name), but it is now decoupled from it, you can use it without Suit.

Here is a quick explanation of how it works:

- you write a base template to add CSS/JavaScript libraries (optional)
- you write a custom AdminSite to override default URLs and/or add others
- you write the corresponding views, inheriting from DashboardView
- each view render the base template (or an extended one) with a grid in
  the context (layout of rows and columns)
- columns can contain boxes of content (visual separation on the page)
- boxes can contain widgets, for which you write the HTML/CSS/JS

So basically django-suit-dashboard does not do much, it just provides a way
to create a dashboard in admin interface without touching too much to HTML
(which not everyone will approve).
