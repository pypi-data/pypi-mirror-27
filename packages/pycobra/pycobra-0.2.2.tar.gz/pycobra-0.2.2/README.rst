pycobra
-------

pycobra is a python library for ensemble learning, which serves as a
toolkit for regression, classification, and visualisation. It is
scikit-learn compatible and fits into the existing scikit-learn
ecosystem.

pycobra offers a python implementation of the COBRA algorithm introduced
by Biau et al. (2016) for regression.

Another algorithm implemented is the EWA (Exponentially Weighted
Aggregate) aggregation technique (among several other references, you
can check the paper by Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2007).

Apart from these two regression aggregation algorithms, pycobra
implements a version of COBRA for classification. This procedure has
been introduced by Mojirsheibani (1999).

pycobra also offers various visualisation and diagnostic methods built
on top of matplotlib which lets the user analyse and compare different
regression machines with COBRA. The Visualisation class also lets you
use some of the tools (such as Voronoi Tesselations) on other
visualisation problems, such as clustering.
