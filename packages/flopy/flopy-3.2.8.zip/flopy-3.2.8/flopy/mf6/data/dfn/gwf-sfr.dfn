longname iprior code
description character string value that defines the the prioritization system for the diversion, such as when insufficient water is available to meet all diversion stipulations, and is used in conjunction with the value of \texttt{flow} value specified in the \texttt{STRESS\_PERIOD\_DATA} section. Available diversion options include:  (1) \texttt{cprior} = `FRACTION', then the amount of the diversion is computed as a fraction of the streamflow leaving reach \texttt{rno} ($Q_{DS}$); in this case, 0.0 $\le$ \texttt{divflow} $\le$ 1.0.  (2) \texttt{cprior} = `EXCESS', a diversion is made only if $Q_{DS}$ for reach \texttt{rno} exceeds the value of \texttt{divflow}. If this occurs, then the quantity of water diverted is the excess flow ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow}) and $Q_{DS}$ from reach \texttt{rno} is set equal to \texttt{divflow}. This represents a flood-control type of diversion, as described by Danskin and Hanson (2002). (3) \texttt{cprior} = `THRESHOLD', then if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), no water is diverted from reach \texttt{rno}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to (\texttt{divflow}), (\texttt{divflow}) is diverted and $Q_{DS}$ is set to the remainder ($Q_{DS} -$ \texttt{divflow})). This approach assumes that once flow in the stream is sufficiently low, diversions from the stream cease, and is the `priority' algorithm that originally was programmed into the STR1 Package (Prudic, 1989).  (4) \texttt{cprior} = `UPTO' -- if $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is greater than or equal to the specified diversion flow (\texttt{divflow}), $Q_{DS}$ is reduced by \texttt{divflow}. If $Q_{DS}$ in reach \texttt{rno} is less than (\texttt{divflow}), \texttt{divflow} is set to $Q_{DS}$ and there will be no flow available for reaches connected to downstream end of reach \texttt{rno}.

longname well status
description keyword option to define stream reach status.  \texttt{status} can be \texttt{ACTIVE}, \texttt{INACTIVE}, or \texttt{SIMPLE}. The \texttt{SIMPLE} \texttt{status} option simulates streamflow using a user-specified stage for a reach or a stage set to the top of the reach (depth = 0). In cases where the simulated leakage calculated using the specified stage exceeds the sum of inflows to the reach, the stage is set to the top of the reach and leakage is set equal to the sum of inflows. Upstream factions should be changed using the \texttt{UPSTREAM\_FRACTION} \texttt{sfrsetting} if the status for one or more reaches is changed to \texttt{ACTIVE} or \texttt{INACTIVE}. For example, if one of two downstream connections for a reach is inactivated, the upstream fraction for the active and inactive downstream reach should be changed to 1.0 and 0.0, respectively, to ensure that the active reach receives all of the downstream outflow from the upstream reach. By default, \texttt{status} is \texttt{ACTIVE}.
