## LazyMEEG

It's an EEG/MEG data analyzer.
You can use a concise string to describe the timepoint(s), condition(s), channel(s) you want to analyse. Calling only one function is enough to produce results and figures. It supports ERP, GFP, Topography plot, TANOVA, MVPA, Clustering, and other channel-based or global-field-based analysis methods. Also, it enables you to try out your own method with little effort, since MEEG is designed as an open-source platform.
