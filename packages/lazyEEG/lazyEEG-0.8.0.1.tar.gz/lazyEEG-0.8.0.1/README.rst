# Installation instructions

lazyEEG has been tested on Python3.5 64bit.
(Current it might be unfit for older versions like Python2.7. But since Python2 will become obsolete in the years to come, why not drop it anyaway and take Python3 instead?)

The simplest way to install lazyEEG is through the Python Package Index (PyPI), which ensures that all required dependencies are established. This can be achieved by executing the following command:

```
pip install lazyEEG
```
or:
```
sudo pip install lazyEEG
```

###*Required Dependencies*
