Hello and thank you for choosing the Telomerecat (Telomere Computational Analysis Tool). Telomerecat is a tool for estimating the average telomere length (TL) for a paired end, whole genome sequencing (WGS) sample.

Telomerecat is adaptable, accurate and fast. The algorithm accounts for sequencing amplification artifacts, anneouploidy (common in cancer samples) and noise generated by WGS. For a high coverage WGS BAM file of around 100GB telomerecat can produce an estimate in ~1 hour.

A full manual for Telomerecat is available at: telomerecat.readthedocs.org

Contact Henry Farmery (jhrf2@cam.ac.uk) for support regarding this tool.
