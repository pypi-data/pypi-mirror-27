Description: Python implementation of the Binary Structured Data Format (BSDF).
        
        BSDF is a binary format for serializing structured (scientific) data.
        See http://bsdf.io for more information.
        
        This is the reference implementation, which is relatively relatively
        sophisticated, providing e.g. lazy loading of blobs and streamed
        reading/writing. A simpler Python implementation is available as
        ``bsdf_lite.py``.
        
        This module has no dependencies and works on Python 2.7 and 3.4+.
        
        Note: on Legacy Python (Python 2.7), non-Unicode strings are encoded as bytes.
Platform: UNKNOWN
