Django Bread
============

Django Bread is a Django app to help build BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit,
Add, Delete) views for Django models.

It helps with default templates, url generation, permissions, filters,
pagination, and more.

This is still very Alpha. We're starting to use it, but the documentation
is very sketchy and the design is still evolving.
