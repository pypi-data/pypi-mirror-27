Carrot is a lightweight task queue backend for Django projects that uses the RabbitMQ message broker, with an emphasis
on quick and easy configuration and task tracking

- Task prioritization
- Task-level monitoring via the Carrot monitor
- Multithreaded queue consumers
- **new in v0.2** built in django-admin daemon


Installation
------------

```
    pip install django-carrot
```


Configuration
-------------

1. Add carrot to your Django project's settings module:

```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'carrot',
        ...
    ]
```

2. Create the carrot migrations and apply them to your project's database:

```
    python manage.py makemigrations carrot
    python manage.py migrate carrot
```

3. Set your default broker in your Django project's settings

```
    CARROT = {
        'default_broker': 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672
    }
```

Usage
-----

To start the service:

```
    python manage.py carrot_daemon start
```

```
    from carrot.utilities import publish_message

    def my_task(**kwargs):
        return 'hello world'

    publish_message(my_task, hello=True)

```

To schedule tasks to run at a given interval

```
    from carrot.utilities import create_scheduled_task

    create_scheduled_task(my_task, {'seconds': 5}, hello=True)
```
