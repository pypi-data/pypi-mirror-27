Description: Behavioural Analysis involves the expressing the general
        expectation of the state of the system while targeting a single or set of heuristics.
        This is particularly helpful when there are large number of factors that can change
        the behaviour of the system and testing all permutations of these input parameters
        is impossible. In such a scenario an assertion of the final expectation can be
        useful in managing performance and regression.
        
        The Behavioural Analysis and Regression Toolkit is based on TRAPpy. The primary goal is
        to assert behaviours using the FTrace output from the kernel
