Mythril
=======

Mythril is a reverse engineering and bug hunting framework for the
Ethereum blockchain.

Installation and setup
----------------------

Install from Pypi:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install mythril

Or, clone the GitHub repo to install the newest master branch:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/b-mueller/mythril/
    $ cd mythril
    $ python setup.py install

You also need a
`go-ethereum <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum>`__ node that is
synced with the network (note that Mythril uses non-standard RPC APIs
only supported by go-ethereum, so other clients likely won't work).
Start the node as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ geth --rpc --rpcapi eth,admin,debug --syncmode fast

Database initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mythril builds its own contract database to enable fast search
operations. Unfortunately, this process is slow. You don't need to sync
the whole blockchain right away though: If you abort the syncing process
with ``ctrl+c``, it will be auto-resumed the next time you run the
``--init-db`` command.

.. code:: bash

    $ myth --init-db
    Starting synchronization from latest block: 4323706
    Processing block 4323000, 3 individual contracts in database
    (...)

Note that syncing doesn't take quite as long as it first seems, because
the blocks get smaller towards the beginning of the chain.

The default behavior is to only sync contracts with a non-zero balance.
You can disable this behavior with the ``--sync-all`` flag, but be aware
that this will result in a huge (as in: dozens of GB) database.

Command line usage
------------------

The Mythril command line tool (aptly named ``myth``) allows you to
conveniently access some of Mythril's functionality.

Searching the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The search feature allows you to find contract instances that contain
specific function calls and opcode sequences. It supports simple boolean
expressions, such as:

.. code:: bash

    $ myth --search "func#changeMultisig(address)#"
    $ myth --search "code#PUSH1 0x50,POP#"
    $ myth --search "func#changeMultisig(address)# and code#PUSH1 0x50#"

Disassembler
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``-d`` flag to disassemble code. The disassembler accepts a
bytecode string or a contract address as its input.

.. code:: bash

    $ myth -d -c "$ ./myth -d -c "5060"
    0 PUSH1 0x60

Specifying an address via ``-a ADDRESS`` will download the contract code
from your node. Mythril will try to resolve function names using the
signatures in ``database/signature.json``:

.. code:: bash

    $ myth -d -a "0x2a0c0dbecc7e4d658f48e01e3fa353f44050c208"
    0 PUSH1 0x60
    2 PUSH1 0x40
    4 MSTORE
    (...)
    1135 - FUNCTION safeAdd(uint256,uint256) -
    1136 CALLVALUE
    1137 ISZERO

Adding the ``-g FILENAME`` option will output a call graph:

.. code:: bash

    $ myth -d -a "0xFa52274DD61E1643d2205169732f29114BC240b3" -g ./graph.svg

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-mueller/mythril/master/static/callgraph.png
   :alt: Call graph

   callgraph

Note that currently, Mythril only processes ``JUMP`` and ``JUMPI``
instructions with immediately preceding ``PUSH``, but doesn't understand
dynamic jumps and function calls.

Tracing Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run a code trace in the PyEthereum virtual machine. Optionally,
input data can be passed via the ``--data`` flag.

.. code:: bash

    $ myth -t -a "0x3665f2bf19ee5e207645f3e635bf0f4961d661c0"
    vm storage={'storage': {}, 'nonce': '0', 'balance': '0', 'code': '0x'} gas=b'21000' stack=[] address=b'6e\xf2\xbf\x19\xee^ vE\xf3\xe65\xbf\x0fIa\xd6a\xc0' depth=0 steps=0 inst=96 pushvalue=96 pc=b'0' op=PUSH1
    vm op=PUSH1 gas=b'20997' stack=[b'96'] depth=0 steps=1 inst=96 pushvalue=64 pc=b'2'
    vm op=MSTORE gas=b'20994' stack=[b'96', b'64'] depth=0 steps=2 inst=82 pc=b'4'

Finding cross-references
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is often useful to find other contracts referenced by a particular
contract. Let's assume you want to search for contracts that fulfill
conditions similar to the `Parity Multisig Wallet
Bug <http://hackingdistributed.com/2017/07/22/deep-dive-parity-bug/>`__.
First, you want to find a list of contracts that use the
``DELEGATECALL`` opcode:

.. code:: bash

    $ myth --search "code#DELEGATECALL#"
    Matched contract with code hash 07459966443977122e639cbf7804c446
    Address: 0x76799f77587738bfeef09452df215b63d2cfb08a, balance: 1000000000000000
    Address: 0x3582d2a3b67d63ed10f1ecaef0dca71b9283b543, balance: 92000000000000000000
    Address: 0x4b9bc00c35f7cee95c65c3c9836040c37dec9772, balance: 89000000000000000000
    Address: 0x156d5687a201affb3f1e632dcfb9fde4b0128211, balance: 29500000000000000000
    (...)

Note that "code hash" in the above output refers to the contract's index
in the database. The following lines ("Address: ...") list instances of
same contract deployed on the blockchain.

You can then use the ``--xrefs`` flag to find the addresses of
referenced contracts:

.. code:: bash

    $ myth --xrefs 07459966443977122e639cbf7804c446
    5b9e8728e316bbeb692d22daaab74f6cbf2c4691

The command-line search is useful for identifying contracts with
interesting opcode patterns. You can either use this information as a
starting point for manual analysis, or build more complex static and
dynamic analysis using Mythril and
`PyEthereum <https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum>`__ modules.

Custom scripts
--------------

TODO

-  Add examples for static/dynamic analysis
-  API documentation

Issues
------

The RPC database sync solution is not very efficient. I explored some
other options, including:

-  Using PyEthereum: I encountered issues syncing PyEthereum with
   Homestead. Also, PyEthApp only supports Python 2.7, which causes
   issues with other important packages.
-  Accessing the Go-Ethereum LevelDB: This would be a great option.
   However, PyEthereum database code seems unable to deal with
   Go-Ethereum's LevelDB. It would take quite a bit of effort to figure
   this out.
-  IPC might allow for faster sync then RPC - haven't tried it yet.

I'm writing this in my spare time, so contributors would be highly
welcome!

Credit
------

JSON RPC library is adapted from
`ethjsonrpc <https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethjsonrpc>`__ (it doesn't
seem to be maintained anymore, and I needed to make some changes to it).

Act responsibly!
----------------

The purpose of project is to aid discovery of vulnerable smart contracts
on the Ethereum mainnet and support research for novel security flaws.
If you do find an exploitable issue or vulnerable contract instances,
please `do the right
thing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure>`__. Also,
note that vulnerability branding ("etherbleed", "chainshock",...) is
highly discouraged as it will annoy the author and others in the
security community.
