**This is still under heavy development**

The idea behind this a container that can store data and time tag the data when
it is captured. The main structure is a `dict` which has keys for each data
series stored.

Setup
--------

Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The suggested way to install this is via the ``pip`` command as follows::

	pip install the_collector

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows::

	git clone https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/the-collector
	cd the-collector
	pip install -r requirements
	pip install -e .

Usage
--------

In the code example below, sensor data is saved to a file. Specifically, it is saving:

- imu: accel, gyro, magnetometer
- camera: raspberry pi images.

Every time data is pushed into the Bag file, each data point is given a time stamp.
Thus, for the camera, the Bag (which is a dictionary) would have an array of:

.. code-block:: python

	bag['camera'] = [[frame0, stamp], [frame1, stamp], ... ]
	bag['imu'] = [[imu0, stamp], [imu1, stamp], ... ]

where ``stamp`` is a time stamp, ``frame`` is an image from from a camera, and imu
is an array of [accel, gyro, magnetometer] data. Now to save data to disk:

.. code-block:: python

	from the_collector.bagit import BagWriter
	import time

	# this file name gives a time/date when it was created
	# you don't have to do this, 'data.json' would work fine too
	filename = 'robot-{}.json'.format(time.ctime().replace(' ', '-'))

	# create the writer
	bag = BagWriter()
	bag.open(filename, ['imu', 'camera'])

	# camera images are binary arrays, we are going to base64 encode them
	# so we can store them in a json file nicely
	bag.stringify('camera')  # this can be a string or an array of keys

	try:
		while True:
			# read and get imu data, say: data = imu.read()
			# always push (key, data), push will add a timestamp
			bag.push('imu', data)

			# read camera, say: ret, frame = camera.read()
			bag.push('camera', frame)

	except KeyboardError:
		bag.write()  # actually writes the data to disk

To read data from a bag file:

.. code-block:: python

	from the_collector.bagit import BagReader

	reader = BagReader()
	data = reader.load('my_file.json')  # read in the file and conver to dict

	# now print everything out
	for key, value in data.items():
		print('-- {} -----------------'.format(key))
		for sample in value:
			point, timestamp = sample
			print(timestamp, point)
		print('')

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can turn on or off compress to reduce file size. If you use the compression,
then it really **isn't a json file anymore**. Thus, other programs won't be able
to read it.

.. code-block:: python

	bag = BagWriter()           # or BagReader()
	bag.use_compression = True  # or False (default)

Examples
---------

See ``examples`` folder	examples how to capture images and record them.
