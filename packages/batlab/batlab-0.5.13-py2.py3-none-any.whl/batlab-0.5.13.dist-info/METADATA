Git branching model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We follow the development model described `here <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_. Anything in the ``master`` branch is considered production. Most work happens in the ``develop`` branch or in a feature branch that is merged into ``develop`` before being merged into ``master``.

Documenting
~~~~~~~~~~~



Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the unit tests, from the root directory run:

``$ python setup.py test``

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

This library is deployed to `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/batlab>`_. Builds are generated with `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/Lexcelon/batlab-software-python>`_ with each pushed commit. When a new tag is pushed or merged into ``master``, that build is automatically deployed to end users through PyPi.
