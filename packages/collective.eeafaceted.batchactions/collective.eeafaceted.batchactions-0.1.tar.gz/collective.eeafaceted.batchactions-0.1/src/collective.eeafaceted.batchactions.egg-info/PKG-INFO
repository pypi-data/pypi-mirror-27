        How it works
        ============
        
        This will display BrowserViews registered for `collective.eeafaceted.batchactions.interfaces.IBatchActionsMarker` or
        an interface subclassing it at the bottom of a eea.facetednavigation dashboard.
        
        Using a `collective.eeafaceted.z3ctable` `CheckBoxColumn`, you will be able to select elements to tigger the batch action on.
        
        Batch actions are overridable from a faceted navigation container to another if necessary.
