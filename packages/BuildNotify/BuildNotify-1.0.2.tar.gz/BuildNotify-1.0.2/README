BuildNotify is a CCMenu equivalent for Ubuntu. (or CCtray equivalent for Ubuntu if you happen to use windows). It resides in your system tray and notifies you of the build status for different projects on your continuous integration servers. BuildNotify is largely inspired from the awesome CCMenu available for Mac.
