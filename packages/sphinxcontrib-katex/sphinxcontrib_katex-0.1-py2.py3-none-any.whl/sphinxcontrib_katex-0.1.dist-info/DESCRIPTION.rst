The extension uses `KaTeX <https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/>`_ for
rendering of math in HTML pages. Itis designed as a replacement
for mathjax which is slower in rednering, but comes as a build
in extension with sphinx
`sphinx.ext.mathjax
<https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/master/sphinx/ext/mathjax.py>`_.
