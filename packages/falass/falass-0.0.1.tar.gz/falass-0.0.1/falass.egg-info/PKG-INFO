Description: falass is a pure python program designed to obtain neutron or x-ray reflectometry data from a molecular simulation output.
        
        This code will read in a PDB structure, allow the input of scattering lengths for each of the atom types, build the system into a series of layers and calculate the reflectometry based on the Abeles optical matrix formalism.
        
        Further it is then possible to compare the calculated reflectometry with that from a experimental data file.
