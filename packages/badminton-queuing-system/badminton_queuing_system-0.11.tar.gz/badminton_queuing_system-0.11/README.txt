Author: Yi Wang Lauguage: Python

This software is used to control the queuing system in a badminton club (or any club to share courts among players).

The rules are:

A player must check in to appear on the player list.
Every time a player wants to join a court, he/she must login with a pin.
A player can only join one court at any time.
A court allows up to 4 players to play simultanously. If already have 4 players, the newly joined player must wait. A court can have up to 4 players waiting.
If all courts are full (with waiting queues are all of 4 players), no players can join any more.
players currently occupying the court can play a period of time that was set by the club (i.e. a round). When a round is over, current players must give up the court to waiting players.
If a round has 1/3 of time left, a new player can only join the waiting list, not the court directly. However, current players may accept the player to play already.
If nobody is waiting. players can continue to play until other players joins this court.
A player can withdraw from a court's waiting list; but cannot withdraw once start to play.
After a round is over or withdraw from a waiting list, the player can now join a court again.
courts that are closed or reserved are not open for play.
