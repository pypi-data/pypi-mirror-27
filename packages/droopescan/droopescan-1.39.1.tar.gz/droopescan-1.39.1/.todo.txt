    - https://github.com/droope/droopescan/issues/18
    - lib/upgrade.txt for moodle. /lib/db/install.xml also discloses version in form of date that you can correlate
    - Fix issue with fake 200. These get handled OK for module detection but it tricks IMU into thinking all files exist.

    - Some SS sites have started blocking all readme.md files. Results look suspect.
        [+] Known silverstripe folders have returned 404 Not Found. If a module does not have a README.md file it will not be detected.

        CWP are made available by the NZ Government here

    - Themes in wordpress sites return 500 errors. These get classified as
          random errors but may be indicative of those files being present.

    - Space after URL results in double slashes:

    - Double redirects, e.g. for http://example.org/ -> http://www.example.org -> https://www.example.org/ result in the following output:
        root@host:~# droopescan scan -u example.org
        [+] Accepted redirect to https://example.org/
        [+] Site identified as drupal.
        [+] Expected folder returned status '301', expected file returned not found status.
        [+] It is possible that https://example.org/ is not running drupal. If you disagree, please specify a --method
    - Interesting URLs does not follow redirects currently. A request for
        wp-admin will not be detected if it results in a redirect to the HTTPs
        site for example.

Version 2.x:
    UA:
        - Move to using API instead of crawling the website for github calls https://api.github.com/repos/joomla/joomla-cms/git/refs/tags.
    - Break API to remove finds, isempty. Instead, simply return finds.
    - Break API to replace 'interesting urls' key with 'interesting_urls'.
    - Break API to add url (the URL which was requested to be scanned) and final_url which is the URL after redirects.
    - Break API to detect plugin version.
    - Add detection of downloadable configuration file backup (e.g. configuration.php~)
    - Add detection of exposed .git.
