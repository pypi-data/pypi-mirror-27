Tox-Pipenv
==========

A Tox plugin to replace the default use of virtualenv with Pipenv.

This is a convenient way to retain your use of Pipenv, whilst testing multiple versions of Python.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install tox-pipenv

Or, 

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv install tox-pipenv  

Creating virtual environments
-----------------------------

With this plugin, tox will use `pipenv --python {python binary}` as given to the tox interpreter for each python path.

If you already have virtual environments cached with tox, use the --recreate flag to recreate them with pipenv.

Note: Tox will pass the --site-packages flag to pipenv if this is configured in your Tox config.

The Pipfile will exist in .tox/{env}/Pipfile as well as Pipfile.lock

Installing requirements
-----------------------

The installation of requirements from your tox config will be passed to pipenv install for installation into the virtual 
environment. This replaces the use of pip within tox.

Executing tests
---------------

Each of the commands in your testenv configuration will be passed to pipenv to execute within the pipenv virtual environment
