Hi! I download and send audios from videos/tracks/sets/albums in *MP3 128 kbps* with tags and artwork.
• Send or forward a message containing links to me in PM and I will download every link from it immediately.
• Send or forward a message containing links to groups with me and I will scan it for supported links and ask you.
• [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_, so I scan every group message.
• `/dl <links>` to download immediately in groups.
• `/link <links>` to get direct download URLs only.
• /flood to toggle replies and spam captions on / off.
• Files over 50 MB (bot-sent size limit) are split into parts.
• Supported links and resources:
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists/pages with private widgets
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums/custom links
*YouTube*: videos/playlists/no lives
*Mixcloud, Vimeo and* [everything from this list](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) (no VK music)
