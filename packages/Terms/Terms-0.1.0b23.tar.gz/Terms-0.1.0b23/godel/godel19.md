<p>Another take, from <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200604/fea-davis.pdf">this essay</a> by Martin Davis.
His argument, in essence, is the following, quoted from the referenced essay.

<blockquote>
<p>There is a computable function  f whose range K is not computable.

<p>[...]

<p>Consider propositions of the form "n does not belong to K", where n is a fixed natural number.
We can suppose that, in a particular formal system these propositions are each represented
by a corresponding string of symbols we may write as Pn.

<p>[...]
  
<p>Let F be a sound formal system. Then there is a number n0 such that n0 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that Pn0 is provable in F.
</blockquote>

<p>Let's consider another formal system F'.
We can also prove that there is a number n1 such that n1 does not belong to K,
but it is not the case that P'n1 is provable in F'.

<p>Should we merge both numbers and think of a single one for all F?
The problem is that the proof that Pn0 is not provable in F
is based on an enumeration of theorems in F,
and not in any F, but in the particular F that we trying to prove that Pn0 is not provable in.
  
<p>So in principle, there is no reason to consider them equal. And, if we try to build it (them),
  it will be a construction, like GÃ¶del's, that depends on the particular F,
  so it will be most surely different if we use different F.
