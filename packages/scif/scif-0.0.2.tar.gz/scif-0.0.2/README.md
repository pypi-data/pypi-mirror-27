# Scientific Filesystem (SCI-F)

The The Scientific Filesystem is an organizational format for scientific software and metadata. Our goals are centered around  **consistency**, **transparency**, **programmatic accessibility**, and **modularity**. [Read about](http://containers-ftw.org/SCI-F/) the format and please [contribute](https://github.com/containers-ftw/SCI-F/issues)!

## What is this?

This module will provide tools for generating and interacting with scientific filesystems, optimized for use on a host or inside a container.  The library is currently under heavy development, and it will be announced when the beta is ready. Stay tuned!
