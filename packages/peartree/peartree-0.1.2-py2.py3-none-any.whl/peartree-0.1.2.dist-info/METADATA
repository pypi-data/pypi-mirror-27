Peartree is a library for converting `GTFS <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/>`__ feed schedules into a representative directed network graph. The tool uses `Partridge <https://github.com/remix/partridge>`__ to convert the target operator schedule data into `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`__ dataframes and then `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`__ to hold the manipulated schedule data as a directed multigraph.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    import peartree as pt

    path = 'path/to/actransit_gtfs.zip'

    # Automatically identify the busiest day and
    # read that in as a Partidge feed
    feed = pt.get_representative_feed(path)

    # Set a target time period to
    # use to summarize impedance
    start = 7*60*60  # 7:00 AM
    end = 10*60*60  # 10:00 AM

    # Converts feed subset into a directed
    # network multigraph
    G = pt.load_feed_as_graph(feed, start, end)

Installation
------------

Note: Still a WIP. Current version on PyPI not good...

.. code:: console

    pip install peartree
