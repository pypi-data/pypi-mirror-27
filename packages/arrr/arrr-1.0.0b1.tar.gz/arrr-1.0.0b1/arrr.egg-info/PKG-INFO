Description: Arrr - Pirate Speak for Python
        ==============================
        
        A simple script / module to turn plain English into Pirate. Arrr.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install simply type::
        
            $ pip install arrr
        
        ...and the package will download from PyPI. If you wish to upgrade to the
        latest version, use the following command::
        
            $ pip install --no-cache --upgrade arrr
        
        Command Usage
        -------------
        
        Once installed, you'll find you have a ``pirate`` command to use in your shell.
        
        To read the (non-Pirate friendly) help, simply type::
        
            $ pirate --help
        
        or::
        
            $ pirate -h
        
        To translate plain English into something Pirate-ish simply call the command
        followed by some English sentence::
        
            $ pirate hello there. how are you today?
            Ahoy there. Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen! How are ye today?
        
        The ``pirate`` command will reply with a Pirate-ish equivalent (as shown
        above).
        
        .. note::
        
            **This software misbehaves like a Pirate.**
        
            Sometimes, the ``pirate`` command will not only translate English to
            Pirate-ish, but will also interject with Pirate sayings (such as,
            "Weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen!" as shown above).
        
            This is entirely normal and perfectly Piratical behaviour. What else
            were you expecting..?
        
        Using the API
        -------------
        
        The ``arrr`` module's API is fully documented below. All you really need is to
        import the ``translate`` function and use that to return Pirate-ish sentences
        from a given input in English::
        
            from arrr import translate
        
        
            english = "Hello there. How are you?"
            pirate = translate(english)
            print(pirate)
        
        The script above will print output similar to that for the command-line usage
        example shown above.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        The source code is hosted in GitHub. Please feel free to fork the repository.
        Assuming you have Git installed you can download the code from the canonical
        repository with the following command::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/ntoll/arrr.git
        
        Ensure you have the correct dependencies for development installed by creating
        a virtualenv and running::
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Pull requests are most welcome! Honestly, the ``arrr`` module was cobbled
        together in about 5 minutes and I went overboard (geddit?) with creating a
        simple yet well packaged and documented project so ``arrr`` can act as a good
        example for beginner developers.
