        HPS platform library
        ++++++++++++++++++++
        
        This library contains modules for developing the platform for the games
        played in CSCI-GA 2965, Heuristic Problem Solving with Prof. Dennis Shasha at NYU.
        
        The following modules are available:
        
        1. **servers**
               The ``servers`` package contains a Python 3 server classes that can use
               either sockets or `ZeroMQ <http://zeromq.org/>`_ for trasportation of
               messages. Both servers support sending and recieving of large messages
               and sending to one or all clients.
        
        2. **clients**
               The ``clients`` package contains clients for the server in a few languages.
               They all implement the similar interface. Currently, Python 3, C++ and Java
               clients are implemented. See the `clients/README.rst <./hps/clients/README.rst>`_
               for details on the clients.
        
        See the `docs <./docs>`_ directory for the API documentation for all the modules
        and classes.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        To install the server module, run ::
        
            pip install --user hps-nyu
        
        This will install the package in the current user's home directory, and does not
        require root access. It can now be imported directly into your Python script.
        
        To import a particular server class, use ``from hps.servers import <ServerClass>``.
        
        For installing clients, see the README.rst file in the individual client directories.

        We hope that this can be ever growing library for the course. Please feel free to
        send in pull requests with bug fixes, new features or even entirely new modules
        that may be relevant for the course.
