collective.z3cform.select2
==========================

Features
--------

- select2 multivalued facetednavigation widget for 2-level vocabulary created
  with collective.taxonomy.
  Select "Select2" criteria in facetednavigation and select a taxonomy.
- select2 multivalued z3c.form widget that works nice with 2-level vocabulary
  created with collective.taxonomy
- Upon installation, the default zc3form widget for List/Set of Choice will be
  select2 based. If you don't want this behavior, you can exclude
  collective.z3cform.select2.widget adapters.zcml with z3c.unconfigure.


Theming
-------

The widget was developped initially for a bootstrap 3 theme and fontawesome.
There is a search button icon left to the select that upon click open the select.
If your site doesn't have a bootstrap based theme, you may want to add this
css rule to your project to hide the tiny button::

    button[data-select2-open] { display: none; }

The z3cform widget in display mode uses the badge class, without a comma
separator so it may be confusing when you don't have style for the badge class.
You can revert to a comma separated display by including minimal.zcml instead
of configure.zcml, see Installation below.


Translations
------------

- One constant Faceted.taxonomyAllString currently in French.


Installation
------------

Install collective.z3cform.select2 by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.z3cform.select2
    zcml =
        collective.z3cform.select2
        # or collective.z3cform.select2-minimal


and then running ``bin/buildout``

You need to install the collective.z3cform.select2 addon to register the
select2 js library. In a facetednav, add a Select2 criterion.
