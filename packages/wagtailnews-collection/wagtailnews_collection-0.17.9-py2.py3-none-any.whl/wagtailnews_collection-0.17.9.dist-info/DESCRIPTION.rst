wagtailnews
===========

A fork of the wagtailnews_ plugin  for Wagtail that provides news / blogging functionality.  This fork exists to allow news items to belong to a collection, enforcing collection permissions and restrictions (including viewer restrictions, mirroring the ``Page`` queryset's ``public()`` method and restricting unauthorized serving in the same way).  This is done to facilitate wagtailnews working with the wagtailapproval_ plugin.

Installing
==========

Install using pip::

    pip install wagtailnews-collection

It works with Wagtail 1.4 and upwards.

Documentation
=============

`Documentation for Wagtail news <http://wagtail-news.readthedocs.org>`_ can be found on Read The Docs.  This fork has no specific documentation, as it works almost exactly the same.

Quick start
===========

Create news models for your application that inherit from the relevant ``wagtailnews`` models:

.. code:: python

    from django.db import models

    from wagtail.wagtailadmin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel
    from wagtail.wagtailcore.fields import RichTextField
    from wagtail.wagtailcore.models import Page

    from wagtailnews.models import NewsIndexMixin, AbstractNewsItem, AbstractNewsItemRevision
    from wagtailnews.decorators import newsindex


    # The decorator registers this model as a news index
    @newsindex
    class NewsIndex(NewsIndexMixin, Page):
        # Add extra fields here, as in a normal Wagtail Page class, if required
        newsitem_model = 'NewsItem'


    class NewsItem(AbstractNewsItem):
        # NewsItem is a normal Django model, *not* a Wagtail Page.
        # Add any fields required for your page.
        # It already has ``date`` field, and a link to its parent ``NewsIndex`` Page
        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
        body = RichTextField()

        panels = [
            FieldPanel('title', classname='full title'),
            FieldPanel('body', classname='full'),
        ] + AbstractNewsItem.panels

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title


    class NewsItemRevision(AbstractNewsItemRevision):
        newsitem = models.ForeignKey(NewsItem, related_name='revisions')
