'''Extend standard modules including "future" features in current versions.

Version 3 introduce several concepts in standard modules.  Sometimes these
features are implemented in the evolution of 2.7.x versions.  By using
sub-modules, these differences can be avoided transparently.  For example, you
can import `xoutil.future.collections.UserDict`:class: in any version, that
it's equivalent to Python 3 `collections.UserDict`:class:, but it don't exists
in Python 2.

.. versionadded:: 1.7.2

# Ensure that, inside all 'xoutil.future' sub-modules, the ABC register method
