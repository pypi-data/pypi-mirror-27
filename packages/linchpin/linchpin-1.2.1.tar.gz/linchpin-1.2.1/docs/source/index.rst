About LinchPin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Welcome to the LinchPin documentation!

LinchPin is a hybrid cloud orchestration tool. Its intended purpose is managing cloud resources across multiple infrastructures. These resources can be provisioned, decommissioned, and configured all using a topology file and a simple command-line interface.

Additionally, LinchPin provides a Python API (and soon a RESTful API) for managing resources. The cloud management component is backed by `Ansible <https://ansible.com>`. The front-end API manages the interface between the command line (or other interfaces) and calls to the Ansible API.

This documentation covers the current released version of LinchPin (|version|). For recent features, we attempt to note in each section the version of LinchPin where the feature was added.
