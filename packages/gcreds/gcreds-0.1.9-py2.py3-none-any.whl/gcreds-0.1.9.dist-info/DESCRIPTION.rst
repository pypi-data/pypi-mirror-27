gcreds
======

Inspired by `credstash <https://github.com/fugue/credstash>`__, I ended
up putting `Google Cloud
Datastore <https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview>`__
and `Google Cloud KMS (CLOUD KEY MANAGEMENT
SERVICE) <https://cloud.google.com/kms/>`__ together to make ``gcreds``
to manage credentials in google cloud.

``gcreds`` allows you store (put) and access (get) your credential in
google cloud, and help to reduce security hole like keeping secrets
being stored from your source code control.

Installation
------------

Just run:

::

    pip install gcreds

Getting started
---------------

Before you can use it, it will require a little setup work here:

1. Greate a KMS key ring on ``global`` location, named it like
   ``gcreds``.
2. Under that key ring, create a crypto key named ``gcreds``.

You can customized ``location``, ``key-ring``, ``cryopto-key``.

Once you have it setup, let's try to put some credential.

Storing the password:

::

    $ gcreds put mysecret SxtlB5fBvvAKT7P4
    project_id is not provided, will use default project: [your-default-gcloud-project] instead.

Retriving the password:

::

    $ gcreds get mysecret
    project_id is not provided, will use default project: [your-default-gcloud-project] instead.
    SxtlB5fBvvAKT7P4

You can also redirect a file to it.

Let's have a file contain a super strong password by hand.

::

    $ cat a_super_password.txt
    Y#7U*ubwZh=D^XEq3a_MMyX3NVL_gfk9K4eq2HX

And Let's use the redirect to enter the password

::

    $ gcreds put mysecret < a_super_password.txt
    project_id is not provided, will use default project: [your-default-gcloud-project] instead.

Let's retrive the password

::

    $ gcreds get mysecret
    project_id is not provided, will use default project: [your-default-gcloud-project] instead.
    Y#7U*ubwZh=D^XEq3a_MMyX3NVL_gfk9K4eq2HX
