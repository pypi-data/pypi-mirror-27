# Basic Face Replacer

Based off the phenomenal [deepgaze](https://github.com/mpatacchiola/deepgaze) project, using [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

Subscribes to a work queue and listens for incoming images.  Identifies any faces in them and replaces them with something else. Currently it's just the test.py working.
