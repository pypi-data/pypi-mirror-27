## A command-line utility programmed and maintained by [Jakob.][1]
An extremely modular asynchronous archiving tool for various imageboards,
textboards, and Boorus.

Chandere 2.5.0 is currently in the alpha state of development, and is likely to
bring many bugs. See [HACKING.md][2] for information on reporting issues.

# Websites Supported by the Default Distribution
* 4chan


# Features Supported by the Default Distribution
* Downloading all files present.


# Installation
**Arch Linux** users are encouraged to install Chandere using Pacman, as it is
packaged in the [AUR.][4]

```
$ # If the PKGBUILD is in the current working directory:
$ makepkg -si
```

If you are running a distribution for which Chandere is not yet packaged, or are
not running Linux, the recommended means of installation is through Pip.

```
$ # It is recommended that you use the latest version of pip and setuptools when installing Chandere.
# pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
# pip install --upgrade chandere
```

`setup.py` in the repository's root directory can be used if Pip is not
available, however this is not recommended.

```
# python setup.py install
```

If Chandere is installed with Pip or setup.py, manpages will have to be manually
moved to your manpath.

```
$ make doc
# cp docs/*.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1 # The destination path may be different on your system.
```


# Examples

```
chandere /fit/17018018
```

Download all images from 'https://boards.4chan.org/fit/thread/17018018/' into
the current working directory, preserving the original filenames.

```
chandere -o "{index}.{ext}" /fit/17018018
```

Perform the same as the above, but instead save every image to a filename
containing the index at which it was encountered.

```
chandere /tech/ -w 8chan
```

Download all images from 'https://8ch.net/tech/res/589254.html'.


# Extending

See [HACKING.md][2].


# TODO

* Fix ordering of TARGETS.
* Expose an API such that Chandere can be used as a library.
