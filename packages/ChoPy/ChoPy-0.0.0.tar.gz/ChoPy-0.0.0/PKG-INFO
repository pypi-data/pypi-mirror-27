Description: # ChoPy
        
        Goal: Swiss Army knife for coder-musicians.
        
        ## Current Todo
        
        This project is just getting started. I plan to write this thing for fun over a long period of time.
        
        - Musical object cores: efficient representation of musical primitives.
        - Find a cross-platform library for playing sounds.

        ## Capabilities
        
        A music modeling tool. Representation for music primitives. e.g. individual tone, chord, and multi-track compositions. Operations on primitives: concatenation, superposition, transformation, importing and exporting as different concrete formats. These musical objects should be easy to
        
        ChoPy aims at fast experiments and . The actual serious work should be done in your favorite DAW.
        
        ## The Name
        
        Idea: a famous musician's name + conventional suffix "py". Chopin sounds just right.
