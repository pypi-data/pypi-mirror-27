Reactome Statistics
===================

Metrics and quality coverage at Reactome.

This project aims to provide metrics on Reactome coverage with respect to other biomolecular data sources. For each of a growing number of analyses, we aim to provide:

    - The algorithm/workflow, to allow easy repeats/updates for new releases
    - Tabular data for spot checks and further analysis
    - High quality visualisations. All analysis focus on Reactome Human unless otherwise stated.
