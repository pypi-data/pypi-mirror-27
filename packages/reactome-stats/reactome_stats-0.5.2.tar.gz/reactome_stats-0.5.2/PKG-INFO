Description: 
              ### Metrics and quality coverage at Reactome.
        
              This project aims to provide metrics on Reactome coverage with respect to other biomolecular data sources. For each of a growing number of analyses, we aim to provide:
        
              - The algorithm/workflow, to allow easy repeats/updates for new releases
              - Tabular data for spot checks and further analysis
              - High quality visualisations. All analysis focus on Reactome Human unless otherwise stated.
