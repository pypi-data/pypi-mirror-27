# Carbonara-PyVEX

Python bindings for Valgrind's VEX IR.

Forked from UCSB [PyVEX](https://github.com/angr/pyvex) to be used in [Guanciale](https://github.com/Carbonara-Project/Guanciale).

## Install

Carbonara-PyVEX can be pip-installed:

```bash
pip install carbonara-pyvex
```

However this package is intended to be only a precompiled version of PyVEX in order to make Guanciale more easy to install.

If you want to use PyVEX in your project please consider to use the original version.
