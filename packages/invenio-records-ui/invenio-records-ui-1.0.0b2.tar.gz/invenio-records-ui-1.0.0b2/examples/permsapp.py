"""Flask application example for development with support for permissions.

SPHINX-START

Run the Redis server.

Run the the example development server:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -e .[all]
   $ cd examples
   $ export FLASK_APP=permsapp.py
   $ ./app-setup.sh
   $ ./app-fixtures.sh

Run example development server:

.. code-block:: console

    $ flask run --debugger -p 5000

Try to view record 1::

   http://localhost:5000/records/1

Open the record 1:

   http://localhost:5000/records/1

Try now to open the record 2:

   http://localhost:5000/records/2

As you can see, for this user the action is forbidden.
