# transfat

## Purpose
transfat's purpose is to make playing music files on your car stereo over USB not a total nightmare. Some car stereos play audio files from a (FAT-only) USB device in the order that the files were transfered to the deviceâ€”which is in general not alphanumeric order. This means that when you put on an album, it might start from track 6, then go to track 9 or something. To make things worse, many of these stereos demand that your audio files be either MP3s or WMAs; so say good-bye to your FLACs and Oggs.

Ideally, car stereos should not depend on these small details, but unfortunately, many do. That's where **transfat** comes in:

**transfat** transfers audio files to FAT devices and worries about the annoying details of your car stereo so that you don't have to.

## What exactly does this do?

Say we run

```
$ transfat source drive/destination
```

then **transfat** does some/all of the following:

1. Filters out any unwanted .logs, .cues, etc. in `source`
2. Converts non-MP3s from `source` to temporary MP3s
3. Transfers files to  `destination`
4. Unmounts `drive` and sorts into alphanumeric order
5. Cleans up intermediate files

## Great, how do I install this?

First you need to get some dependencies. Make sure you have
```
fatsort ffmpeg
```
To install transfat run
```
pip3 install transfat
```
If you provide root access to the pip3 installation, you'll get a useful `man` page for the program.
