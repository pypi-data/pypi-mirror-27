WARNING:ConstraintSystem - The Offset constraint <NET "WR_B" OFFSET = IN : 5 :

   [Z:/dev/basil/examples/mio_sram_test/firmware/src/mio.ucf(127)], is specified
   without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing
   reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be
   specified following the 'VALID' keyword.
