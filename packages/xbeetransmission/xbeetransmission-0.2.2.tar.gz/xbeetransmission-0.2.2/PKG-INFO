Description: # xbeetransmission
        `xbeetransmission` is a python module is designed to reliably and securely send messages over Xbee modules in out-of-the-box configuration. 
        
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        `xbeetransmission` can be installed as a module, or downloaded directly from Github.
        
        #### Installed as a module
        
        `xbeetransmission` can be installed directly via pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install pshtt
        ```
        
        #### Usage and examples
        
        ```python
        import xbeetransmission
        
        xbeesend(data, serial_interface_of_xbee, "Symmetric Key Value")
        
        xbeereceive(serial_interface_of_xbee, "Symmetric Key Value", "outputfilename.txt")
        ```
        
        ## Troubleshooting
        * Ensure that you are running the code as sudo to interact with the Xbee module
        * Ensure that your serial interface is correct (should start with /dev/ttyUSB)
        * See example files for reference
        
        ## Hardware I Used
        * XBEE Pro 900 MHz
        * 900 MHz Rubber Duck Antenna
        * XBee USB Dongle
        
        ## Recommendations
        * Encrypt the message before sending with Public/Private keys
