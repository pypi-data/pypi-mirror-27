Creating journal
================

Now we'll create **Tasks** jounal where we store the tasks of our to-do list. 
In the following dialog, fill in the caption and name of the journal and click
the **New** button in the bottom right corner of the dialog.

The **New field** dialog will appear. Type the caption and name of the 
**Created** field, select its type and click **OK** button.

The same way add the **Description** and **Completed** fields and click **OK**

We created **Tasks** journal. If we open todo.sqlite database in the SQLite 
manager, we'll see that jam.py created TOOD_TASKS table in the database as well.
