Spiking neural network conversion toolbox
=========================================

The SNN conversion toolbox contains functions to transform rate-based artificial
neural networks into spiking neural networks, and to simulate them. Please
refer to the `Documentation <http://snntoolbox.readthedocs.io>`_ for a complete
user guide and API reference.
