Description: Mklinks walks supplied paths looking for files with the same content,
        based on a cryptographic checksum of their content. It hardlinks
        all such files found, keeping the newest version.
        
        Unlike some rather naive tools out there, mklinks only compares
        files with other files of the same size, and is hardlink aware - a
        partially hardlinked tree is processed efficiently and correctly.
