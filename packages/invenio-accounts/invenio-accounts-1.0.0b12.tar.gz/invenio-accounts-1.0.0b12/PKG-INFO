        Invenio user management and authentication.
        
        Features:
        
        - User and role management.
        - User registration, password reset/recovery and email verification.
        - Administration interface and CLI for managing users.
        - Session based authentication with session theft protection as well as
          "remember me" support.
        - Strong cryptographic password hashing with support for migrating password
          hashes (including Invenio v1.x) to new stronger algorithms.
        - Session activity tracking allowing users to e.g. logout of all devices.
        - Server-side session management.
        - JSON Web Token encoding and decoding support useful for e.g. CSRF-protection
          in REST APIs.
        
        Invenio-Accounts relies on the following community packages to do all the
        heavy-lifting:
        
        - `Flask-Security <https://flask-security.readthedocs.io>`_
        - `Flask-Login <https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/>`_
        - `Flask-Principal <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Principal/>`_
        - `Flask-KVSession <http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-KVSession/>`_
        - `Passlib <https://passlib.readthedocs.io/>`_
