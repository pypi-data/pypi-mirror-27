Description: # libgql - GraphQL Linked Libraries
        
        ## The Problem
        
        How can I build libraries and modules that operate accross programming
        languages and environments?
        
        ## The Solution
        
        To solve this problem with web services, we build APIs that we can use between
        languages. Unfortunately, these APIs require us to make HTTP requests.
        
        ...or do they?
        
        Enter GraphQL: Protocal Agnostic, that means, we can implement it over a CLI
        interface and have an incredibly handy way to build cross language bindings
        without all the fuss.
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        libgql will define a protocal for doing graphql over CLI and implement as many
        language bindings as we possibly can.
        
        ## Usage
        
        I would recommend looking at the tests for usage, since it varies from language
        to language. To consume a module that uses libgql, install the bindings for your
        language:
        
        | javascript | `yarn add libgql`       |
        |------------|-------------------------|
        | python     | `pipenv install libgql` |
        
        Then import the bindings and load the module:
        
        
        ### javascript
        ```javascript
        import { loadModule } from "libgql"
        
        const myModule = loadModule("./path/to/libgql/module/executable");
        
        result = await myModule(graphqlQueryStringHere, optionalVariables);
        ```
        
        ### python
        
        ```python
        from "libgql" import load_module
        
        myModule = load_module("./path/to/libgql/module/executable")
        
        result = myModule(graphqlQueryStringHere, optionalVariables)
        ```
