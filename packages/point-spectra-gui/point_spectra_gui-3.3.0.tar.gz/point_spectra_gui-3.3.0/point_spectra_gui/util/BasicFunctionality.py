    This class is a scaffolding class, it holds global
    functionality for all classes inheriting from it.
    It is here to simplify and globalize certain
    variables and functionalities to each of the
    UI classes.

    *Note: Rigorous prototyping is still occurring
    So, naturally, assume that something in this class
    is always getting changed or added to better serve
    all cases in each UI class.

    classes it would make sense that we would have
    some variables, that are necessary among all these
    classes, be put here in a high place where they
