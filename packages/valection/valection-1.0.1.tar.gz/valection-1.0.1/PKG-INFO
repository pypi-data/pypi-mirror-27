        --------------------------------------------------
        
        This is a binding for the valection C library and supports C version 1.0.0.
        
        Valection can be used in various ways to sample the outputs of competing algorithims or
        parameterizations, and fairly assess their performance against each other.
        
        This software requires the valection library (http://labs.oicr.on.ca/boutros-lab/software/valection).
