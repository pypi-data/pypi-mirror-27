**trade** is a framework for the development of financial applications. It operates
on the concept of *subjects* and *occurrences*. A *subject* represent anything that
can be traded, while an *occurrence* represent anything that affects one or more
subjects, like a stock exchange operation or a stock split.

It is developed to work with any kind of *subject* and *occurrence* related to
the financial market by following these principles:

- different subjects may have different attributes
- a subject may relate to none or many other subjects
- an occurrence must involve one or many subjects
- there may be an existing context for any subject
- different occurrences can implement different processes
- an occurrence may update the state of none or many subjects

Extending the framework with market-specific rules and exotic operations
should be as simple as creating new types of subjects and occurrences.

You can try it `live <https://python-trade.appspot.com>`_.


In a nutshell
-------------
A **trade** app works like a service. The user informs the items in stock and a series
of subsequent occurrences (purchases, sales, whatsoever) with those or other items.
**trade** then calculates the effects of those occurrences and gives back the
new amounts and costs of the items in stock.


Quickstart
----------

An example of the JSON interface:

.. code:: python

    from trade import trade
    from trade.trade_json import TradeJSON


    interface = TradeJSON(
        [trade.fetch_daytrades],
        {
            'Asset': trade.Asset,
            'Operation': trade.Operation,
        }
    )

    json_input = '''{
        "subjects": {
            "GOOG": {
                "type": "Asset",
                "name": "Google Inc"
            },
            "AAPL": {
                "type": "Asset",
                "name": "Apple, Inc."
            }
        },
        "occurrences": [
            {
