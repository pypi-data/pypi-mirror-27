New:
* InhomogeneousVolumeEmitter integrator now pluggable.
* Added cosine weighted cone random vector sampler.
* Added cython utility for determining polygon winding order for n-sided polygons.
* Added triangulate2d function for splitting N-sided polygon into triangles.
* Added lerp and slerp functions to Vector3D.


Release 0.3.1 (17 Mar 2017)
---------------------------

Fixed:
* max_wavelength property of optical ray was broken.

New:
* Diamond demo.


Release 0.3.0 (8 Mar 2017)
--------------------------

New:
* Added multiple importance sampling (MIS).
* Added micro-facet based materials.
* Added 2D kd-tree and 2D mesh utilities
* Added parabola primitive.
* Added spherical lens primitives.
* Added render engine workflow model with engines targetting single core and multicore rendering.
* Added StatsBin and StatsArray objects.
* Added a set of utility containers (linked-lists etc..) for use in cython.
* Added metals and coloured emission spectra to the optical library.

Changes:
* Completely re-engineered optical observers.
  - New pipeline architecture.
  - Adaptive sampling.
  - Framework simplifies development of new observers.
* Re-engineered spectral functions (API changes are minimal).
* Renamed num_samples and spectral_samples to bins and spectral_bins.
* Renamed ray_min_depth to ray_extinction_min_depth.
* Optimised the codebase for greater rendering performance.
* Updated lambert material to support MIS.
* Tidied up numerous internal interfaces.
