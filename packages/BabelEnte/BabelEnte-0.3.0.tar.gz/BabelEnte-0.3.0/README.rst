Installation
---------------

(not yet ready; to appear soonish)

::

    pip3 install babelente

or clone this github repository and run ``python3 setup.py install``, optionally prepend the commands with ``sudo`` for
global installation.

Usage
-------

You will need a BabelFy API key, get it from `BabelNet.org <http://babelnet.org>`_ .

See ``babelente -h`` for usage for now.

To evaluate a translation (english to portuguese in this example), output wil be JSON to stdout:

``$ babelente -k "YOUR-API-KEY" -f en -t pt -S sentences.en.txt -T sentences.pt.txt > output.json``

To re-evaluate:

``$ babelente --evalfile output.json -S sentences.en.txt -T sentences.pt.txt > newoutput.json``

You can also use BabelEnte to just extract entities a single language, without evaluation:

``$ babelente -k "YOUR-API-KEY" -f en -S sentences.en.txt > output.json``


Evaluation
-----------

The evaluation produces two metrics, computer per sentence/line pair and final score aggregated as macro-average:

* **Precision** -How many of the target synsets are correct? (``|matchingsynsets| / |targetsynsets|``)
* **Recall** - How many of the source synsets are found? (``|matchingsynsets| / |sourcesynsets|``)
