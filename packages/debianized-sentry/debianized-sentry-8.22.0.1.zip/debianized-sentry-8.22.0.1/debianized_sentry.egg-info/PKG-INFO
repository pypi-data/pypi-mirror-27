        This puts the ``sentry`` Python package and its dependencies as released
        on PyPI into a DEB package, using ``dh-virtualenv``.
        The resulting *omnibus package* is thus easily installed to and removed
        from a machine, but is not a ‘normal’ Debian ``python-*`` package.
        Services are controlled by ``systemd`` units.
        
        The final package includes the official ``sentry-plugins`` and some other
        commonly needed plugins.
        
        See the `GitHub README`_ for more.

        The Sentry package fundamentally is just a simple server and web UI.
        It will handle authenticating clients (such as Raven) and all of
        the logic behind storage and aggregation.
        
        That said, Sentry is not limited to Python. The primary implementation
        is in Python, but it contains a full API for sending events from any
        language, in any application.
