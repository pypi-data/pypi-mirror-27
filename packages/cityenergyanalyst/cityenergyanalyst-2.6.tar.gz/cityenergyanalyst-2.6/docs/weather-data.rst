Weather data
============

Weather data files are stored as ``energyPlus``:``.epw`` inside the
folder ``..cea/DB/Weather``. The files can be
`downloaded <https://energyplus.net/weather>`__ for more than 2100
locations in the planet. You can also create your own ``.epw`` file with
tools such as `Meteonorm <http://www.meteonorm.com>`__. The City Energy
Analyst V1.0b ships with hourly data of a Typical Meteorological Year
for the locations of Zurich, Zug and Singapore.
