Archetypes
==========

An Archetype is a database relating the typology of buildings to
historical data about their construction, energy systems, operation etc.
The function of this database is to help the user to retrieve inputs for
his analysis when data is scarce.

We can call it as default data for any type of simulation. Bear in mind
that this data is highly dependent of local context. The City Energy
Analyst V1.0b ships with data for the Swiss-European context as a
default for up to 15 types of building typologies. Each building
typology is classified according to a year of construction and/or
renovation and a type of occupancy in the building.

*Note: You are encouraged to build an Archetypes database for your local
area. If you decide to use the existing please remember to acknowledge
