Description: # magnetmatter
        Material Science Research Data Visualization.
        FullProf .prf, .out and .pcr files are read and informations on 
        	refined parameters, 
        	phases, 
        	appearent crystalline sizes
        	phase fractions 
        are hardcoded next to the graph of "Yobs", "Ycal" and "Yobs-Ycal".
        
        
        #### HOW TO INSTALL:
        This installation assumes that you have a plain python (version > 3.0) installed that can be accessed through the command prompt.
        
        	pip install magnetmatter
        
        #### HOW TO USE:
        once it has been installed along with dependencies ("numpy", "pandas", "matplotlib", it may take a while, be patient), type python/python3 in command prompt. then type
            
            import magnetmatter as mogens
        
        this may also take a while to load everything. Type now
        
            path = r"C:\give\a\valid\path\to\folder\with\datasubfolders\"
            mogens.plot_prf(path)
        
        The default printed size is 8 cm (two plots fit into a docx document). other options include:
        
        	mogens.plot_prf(path, printsize = "two_in_docx") # 8  cm wide
        	mogens.plot_prf(path, printsize = "one_in_docx") # 15 cm wide
        	mogens.plot_prf(path, printsize = "two_in_ppt")  # 17 cm wide
        	mogens.plot_prf(path, printsize = "one_in_ppt")  # 32 cm wide
        	
        The files are saved as .png in the "path" folder.
