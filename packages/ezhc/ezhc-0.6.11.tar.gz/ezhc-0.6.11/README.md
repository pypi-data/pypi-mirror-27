# ezhc

**ezhc** stands for easy Highcharts.
[Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) is a popular, flexible, versatile, user friendly visualisation javascript library.
Currently only [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo) and [Highstock](http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo), not [Highmap](http://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo).

**ezhc** is a wrapper that lets you transparently access the full configuration options of the library as described in their APIs, directly from the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/):
+ [Highcharts](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts)
+ [Highstock](http://api.highcharts.com/highstock)

You just need to store the data in a [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframe.
See the examples in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/oscar6echo/ezhc/blob/master/demo_ezhc.ipynb).

To install run from command line:
```
pip install ezhc
```

There are exceptions to the transparent wrapping approach:  
I added 2 datatables ([datatables.net](http://datatables.net/)) linked to the Highstock call.  
A footer (described in HTML) can be added below a plot. If the footer contains an image, it will be burned into the standalone file upon save.  
Cf. examples in the notebook.
