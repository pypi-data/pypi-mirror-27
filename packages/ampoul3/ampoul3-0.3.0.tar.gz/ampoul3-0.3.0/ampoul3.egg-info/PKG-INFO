Description: 
        ampoule - Python process pool for Twisted Matrix
        =================================================
        
        Ampoule is a process pool implementation written on top of Twisted
        Matrix. Its name comes from the use of AMP as the default
        communication protocol between the pool and all its children.
        
        It's different from other alternative solutions because it provides an
        API very close to that of the Twisted ThreadPool. As an helper
        function it also provides a deferToAMPProcess function that creates
        the ProcessPool and submits jobs to it.
