Description: 
            Multiview clustering and dimensionality reduction
            
            The multiview package provides multiview methods to work with
            multiview data (datasets with several data matrices from the same
            samples). It contains methods for multiview dimensionality reduction
            and methods for multiview clustering.
        
            Multiview dimensionality reduction
            
            Given a multiview dataset with v input data matrices,multiview
            dimensionality reduction methods produce a single, low-dimensional
            projection of the input data samples, trying to mantain as much of the
            original information as possible.
        
            Package multiview offers the function :doc:`mvmds` to perform multiview
            dimensionality reduction in a similar way than the multidimensional scaling
            method (cmdscale in R).
        
            Another dimensionality reduction function in this package is :doc:`mvtsne`,
            that extends tsne in R to multiview data.
        
            Multiview clustering
            
            Given a multiview dataset with v input data matrices, multiview
            clustering methods produce a single clustering assignment, considering
            the information from all the input views.
            Package multiview offers the function :doc:`mvsc` to perform multiview
            spectral clustering. It is an extension to spectral clustering
            (in R) to multiview datasets.
