# ATLAS Matplotlib Style

Provides a Matplotlib style replicating that used by the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern) collaboration.

In addition, this package also provides:

- A matplotlib style based on the background / foreground from the VIM [Paper](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme)
  color scheme, along with a print version with a white background.
    - The default color cycle in all three styles is from the ggplot theme included with Matplotlib
- Additional Matplotlib color definitions based on the Paper theme, and the [Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme) theme
- A function to draw the ATLAS label (requires `usetex: true` as set by the included ATLAS style)
