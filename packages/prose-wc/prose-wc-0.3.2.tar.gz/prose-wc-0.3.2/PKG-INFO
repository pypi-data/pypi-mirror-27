        A prose- and Jekyll-aware wordcount utility.
        
        About
        -----
        
        Given the proliferation of Markdown and the use of Jekyll as a blogging
        platform, the builtin ``wc`` utility came up short.  Even for plain-text
        prose, ``wc`` can leave much to be desired.  To that end, ``prose-wc`` will
        calculate proper word, paragraph, and character counts for a given plaintext,
        or markdown file or stream through STDIN.
        
        Also, Madison wanted to learn how to package for PyPI.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ::
        
            pip install prose-wc
        
        Running
        -------
        
        ::
        
            usage: prose-wc [-h] [-S] [-u] [-f [{yaml,json,default}]] [-i [INDENT]] file
        
            Compute Jekyl- and prose-aware wordcounts
        
            positional arguments:
              file                  file to count (or - for STDIN)
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -S, --split-hyphens   split hyphenated words rather than counting them as
                                    one word ("non-trivial" counts as two words rather
                                    than one)
              -u, --update          update the jekyll file in place with the counts. Does
                                    nothing if the file is not a Jekyll markdown file.
                                    Implies format=yaml, invalid with input from STDIN and
                                    non-Jekyll files.
              -f [{yaml,json,default}], --format [{yaml,json,default}]
                                    output format.
              -i [INDENT], --indent [INDENT]
                                    indentation depth (default: 4).
        
            Accepted filetypes: plaintext, markdown, markdown (Jekyll)
        
        Running ``prose-wc`` against a file will generate a series of counts
        that might be of use. You can get these counts in a simple,
        tab-separated format, JSON, or YAML. If you're working with a Jekyll
        markdown file, you can also choose to have this data embedded in the
        frontmatter as YAML.
        
        Other filetypes
        ---------------
        
        You can use `pandoc <http://pandoc.org>`__ to convert your file and pipe
        it into prose-wc:
        
        ::
        
            pandoc -f latex -t plain my_great_story.tex | prose-wc -
        
        In a Jekyll site
        ----------------
        
        You can add wordcount information to your site by running ``prose-wc -u
        <file>``, which will update the Jekyll frontmatter to include the results in
        YAML format.  This data can then be included on the page in some place handy such as at the top of a post in ``_layouts/post.html`` with:
        
        .. code:: liquid
        
            {% if page.counts %}
                <p class="text-muted small">
                    {{ page.counts.paragraphs }} {% if page.counts.paragraphs == 1 %}paragraph{% else %}paragraphs{% endif %} &bullet;
                    {{ page.counts.words }} words
                </p>
            {% endif %}
        
        This would result in something like
        `this <http://writing.drab-makyo.com/posts/tasting/2016/09/17/teas-of-late/>`__.
        
        You can add wordcounts to posts with a find command like:
        
        ::
        
            find . \( -name '*.md' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -exec prose-wc -u "{}" \;
