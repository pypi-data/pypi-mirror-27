The StagyyData class
====================

The StagyyData class is a generic lazy accessor to StagYY output data you can
use in your own Python scripts. This section assumes the StagyyData instance
is called ``sdat``. You can create this instance like this::

    from stagpy import stagyydata
    sdat = stagyydata.StagyyData('path/to/run/')

where ``path/to/run/`` is the path towards the directory containing your run
(where the ``par`` file is). This path can be absolute or relative to the
current working directory. It can be a regular string, or a
:class:`pathlib.Path` object.

Snapshots and time steps
------------------------

A StagYY run is a succession of time steps with information such as the mean
temperature of the domain outputted at each time step. Now and then, radial
profiles and complete fields are saved, constituting a snapshot.

A StagyyData instance has two attributes to access time steps and snapshots
in a consistent way: ``sdat.steps`` and ``sdat.snaps``. Accessing the ``n``-th
time step or the ``m-th`` snapshot is done using square brackets::

    sdat.steps[n]
    sdat.snaps[m]

These two expressions each return a :class:`_Step` instance. Moreover, if the
``m``-th snapshot was done at the ``n``-th step, both expressions return the
same :class:`_Step` instance. In other words, if for example the 100th snapshot
was made at the 1000th step, ``sdat.steps[1000] is sdat.snaps[100]`` is true.
The correspondence between time steps and snapshots is deduced from available
binary files.

Negative indices are allowed, ``sdat.steps[-1]`` being the last time step
(inferred from temporal series information) and ``sdat.snaps[-1]`` being the
last snapshot (inferred from available binary files).

Finally, ``steps`` and ``snaps`` accessors accept slices. ``sdat.steps[a:b:c]``
returns the generator ``(sdat.steps[n] for n in range(a, b, c))`` (negative
indices are also properly taken care of). This is useful to iterate through
time steps or snapshots. For example, the following code process every even
snapshot::

    for step in sdat.snaps[::2]:
        do_something(step)


Parameters file
---------------

Parameters set in the ``par`` file are accessible through the ``par`` attribute
of a StagyyData instance. ``sdat.par`` is organized as a dictionary of
dictionaries.  For example, to access the Rayleigh number from the ``refstate``
section of the par file, one can use ``sdat.par['refstate']['ra0']``. Parameters
that are not set in the par file are given a default value according to the par
file ``~/.config/stagpy/par``.

Radial profiles
---------------

Radial profile data are contained in the ``rprof`` attribute of a StagyyData
instance. This attribute is a :class:`pandas.DataFrame`. Its :attr:`columns`
are the names of available variables (such as e.g. ``'Tmean'`` and ``'ftop'``).
Its :attr:`index` is a 2 levels multi-index, the first level being the time
step number (:attr:`istep`), and the second level being the cells number (from
``0`` to ``nz-1``). The list of available variables can be obtained by
running ``% stagpy var``.

The radial profile of a given time step can be accessed from
:attr:`_Step.rprof`. For example, ``sdat.steps[1000].rprof`` is equivalent to
``sdat.rprof.loc[1000]``. The columns of the obtained dataframe are the
variable names, and its index is the cells number.

As an example, the following lines are two ways of accessing the horizontal
average temperature in the bottom cell, at the 1000th timestep::

    # extract rprof data for the 1000th timestep,
    # and then take the temperature in the bottom cell
    sdat.rprof.loc[1000].loc[0,'Tmean']
    # extract the temperature profile for the 1000th timestep,
    # and then take the bottom cell
    sdat.rprof.loc[1000,'Tmean'][0]

If the radial profiles of the 1000th timestep are not available, these would
both result in a ``KeyError``.

Time series
-----------

Temporal data are contained in the ``tseries`` attribute of a StagyyData
instance. This attribute is a :class:`pandas.DataFrame`. Its :attr:`columns`
are the names of available variables. Its :attr:`index` is the time steps
number (:attr:`istep`). The list of available variables can be obtained by
running ``% stagpy var``.

The temporal data of a given time step can be accessed from
:attr:`_Step.timeinfo`. For example, ``sdat.steps[1000].timeinfo`` is
equivalent to ``sdat.tseries.loc[1000]``. Both are :class:`pandas.Series`
indexed by the available variables.

As an example, the following lines are three ways of accessing the average
temperature at the 1000th timestep::

    # extract time series info available for the 1000th timestep,
    # and then take the average temperature
    sdat.steps[1000].timeinfo['Tmean']
    # extract the temperature time series,
    # and then take the 1000th timestep
    sdat.tseries['Tmean'][1000]
    # direct access to the wanted info
    sdat.tseries.loc[1000, 'Tmean']


Geometry
--------

Geometry information are read from fields files. :attr:`_Step.geom` has
various attributes defining the geometry of the problem.

``cartesian``, ``curvilinear``, ``cylindrical``, ``spherical`` and ``yinyang``
booleans define the shape of the domain (``curvilinear`` being the opposite of
``cartesian``, ``True`` if ``cylindrical`` or ``spherical`` is ``True``).

``twod_xz``, ``twod_yz``, ``twod`` and ``threed`` booleans indicate the number
of spatial dimensions in the simulation. Note that fields are always four
dimensional arrays (spatial + blocks) regardless of the actual dimension of the
domain.

``nxtot``, ``nytot``, ``nztot``, ``nbtot``, ``nttot``, ``nptot`` and ``nrtot``
are the total number of points in the various spatial directions. Note that
``nttot``, ``nptot`` and ``nrtot`` are the same as ``nxtot``, ``nytot`` and
``nztot`` regardless of whether the geometry is cartesian or curvilinear.

``x_coord``, ``y_coord`` and ``z_coord`` as well as ``t_coord``, ``p_coord``
and ``r_coord`` are the coordinates of cell centers in the threee directions.
As for the total number of points, they are the same regardless of the actual
geometry.

``x_mesh``, ``y_mesh`` and ``z_mesh`` are three dimensional meshes containing
the **cartesian** coordinates of cell centers (even if the geometry is
curvilinear).

``t_mesh``, ``p_mesh`` and ``r_mesh`` are three dimensional meshes containing
the **spherical** coordinates of cell centers (these are set as ``None`` if the
geometry is cartesian).

Scalar and vector fields
------------------------

Vector and scalar fields are accessible through the ``fields`` attribute of a
StagyyData instance, using their name as key. For example, the temperature
field of the 100th snapshot is obtained with ``sdat.snaps[100].fields['T']``.
Valid names of fields can be obtained by running ``% stagpy var``. Fields are
four dimensional arrays, with indices in the order x, y, z and block.
