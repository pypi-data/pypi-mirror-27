## materials

- heavy-duty white glue
- several clips large enough to clamp around the signatures of the book
- fine-grit sandpaper
- cotton swabs
- two flat wooden paint-stirring sticks

## instructions

- Assemble the folded signatures of the book in the proper order. Jog them toward the spine for an even edge.
- Place one wooden stick on the front of the assembled pages and one on the back positioned close to the spine, but not touching. Position the clamps over the spine and the wooden sticks. Clamp everything securely. The sticks prevent the clamps from making indentations in the pages of the book.
- Roughen the edges of the spine with sandpaper. This helps the glue adhere to the paper. Move the clips as needed as you work but don't unclamp the book.
- Using cotton swabs to apply a generous layer of glue to the spine area of the pages.
- Wait for a half hour or so for the glue to dry.
- Apply a second coat of glue to the spine.
- Wait for the glue to dry completely.
- Remove the clamps.
- Attach a pre-folded cover over the book, or use a ruler to make two creases in the cover the same distance apart as the thickness of the spine. This gives a neat fold around the spine area.
- Apply glue to the spine again and press the cover in place. Reclamp the book using the wooden sticks and wait until the cover dries completely.
Remove the clamps and sticks. Trim the cover with a razor blade or utility knife for a neat edge.
