        =========
        
        *A Slack command line program in Python.*
        
        
        Purpose
        -------
        
        A simple command line application for sending Slack messages. My use case is
        to automate sending certain Slack app commands through triggers created with
        (Hammerspoon)[www.hammerspoon.org], but there's nothing stopping it from
        being used for other use cases.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        If you've cloned this project, and want to install the library (*and all
        development dependencies*), the command you'll want to run is::
        
            $ pip install -e .[test]
        
        If you'd like to run all tests for this project (*assuming you've written
        some*), you would run the following command::
        
            $ python setup.py test
        
        This will trigger `py.test <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_, along with its popular
        `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov>`_ plugin.
        
        Lastly, if you'd like to cut a new release of this CLI tool, and publish it to
        the Python Package Index (`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_), you can do so
        by running::
        
            $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            $ twine upload dist/*
        
        This will build both a source tarball of your CLI tool, as well as a newer wheel
        build (*and this will, by default, run on all platforms*).
        
        The ``twine upload`` command (which requires you to install the `twine
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_ tool) will then securely upload your
        new package to PyPI so everyone in the world can use it!
