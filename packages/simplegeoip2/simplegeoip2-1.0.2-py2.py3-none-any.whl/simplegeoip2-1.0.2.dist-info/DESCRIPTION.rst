Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use ``simplegeoip2``, you must have the MaxMind GeoLite2 databases on your system. This simplest way to do
this is to use the ``geoipupdate`` tool from MaxMind.

Installation
------------

While this script should work under Python 2 and 3, using Python 3 for your OS is strongly recommended.

On Debian or Ubuntu systems, run:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip


Python 3 installers for Windows and macOS can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/

To install or upgrade to the latest stable release of checkdmarc on macOS or Linux, run

::

    $ sudo pip3 -U install simplegeoip2

Or, install the latest development release directly from GitHub:

::

    $ sudo pip3 -U install git+https://github.com/domainaware/simplegeoip2.git


Note to Windows users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows, ``pip3`` is ``pip``, regardless if you installed Python 2 or 3. So on Windows, simply
substitute ``pip`` as an administrator in place of ``sudo pip3``, in the above commands.
