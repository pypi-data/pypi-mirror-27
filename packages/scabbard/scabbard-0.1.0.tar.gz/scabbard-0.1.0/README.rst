Scabbard
==========

About
-----

Scabbard is a Pythonic client for the Sabre Dev Studio REST APIs.  With Scabbard, it
is not necessary to create extensive low-level boilerplate code before you can use each API call.
You can begin to make real REST calls to the Sabre Dev Studio APIs with only 3 lines of code (including the import).

A scabbard is a sheath for holding a sword, such as a sabre :)
