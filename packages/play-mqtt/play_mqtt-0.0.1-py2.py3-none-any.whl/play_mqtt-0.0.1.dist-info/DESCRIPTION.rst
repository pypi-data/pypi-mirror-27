``pytest-play`` support for MQTT support.

Thanks to ``play_mqtt`` you can test the integration between a mocked IoT
device that sends commands on MQTT and a reactive web application with UI checks.

You can also build a simulator that generates messages for you.

Features
--------


This project defines a new pytest-play_ command:

::

    {"provider": "mqtt",
     "type": "publish",
     "host": "$mqtt_host",
     "port": $mqtt_port,
     "endpoint": '$mqtt_endpoint',
     "payload": {
         "measure_id": [100],
         "obj_id_L": [0],
         "measureType": ["float"],
         "start_time": 1514911926114,
         "bin_value": [77251432]
     }
    }

You can add more commands adding new methods to the command provider implementation in ``providers.py`` module.

More info and examples on:

* pytest-play_, documentation
* cookiecutter-qa_, see ``pytest-play`` in action with a working example if you want to start hacking

Thanks to pytest-play_ you can drive your tests or simulators through a configuration file containing
an array of commands.
