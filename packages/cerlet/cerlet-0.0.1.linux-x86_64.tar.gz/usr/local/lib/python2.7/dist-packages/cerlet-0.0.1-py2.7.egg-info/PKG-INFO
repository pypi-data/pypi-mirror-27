Description: # CerLet CertMonger Let's Encrypt Helper
        Helper integration to allow certmonger to communicate with the Let's Encrypt CA
        
        This package integrates Certmonger (and by extension FreeIPA/Sattellite) with
        the Let's Encrypt community Certificate Authority.
        
        This allows hosts in FreeIPA to automatically get publically trusted certificates
        for all purposes.
        
        Due to using DNS based authentication certificates ban be issued for private
        servers as well as public ones without any service interruptions. This also
        allows certificates to include an alias per principal or any number of host/DNS
        names.
        
        This package includes python libraries which will be installed in the default
        site-packages directory of your python distribution (or virtualenv) and an entry
        point script that will be installed under /usr/libexec/certmonger.
