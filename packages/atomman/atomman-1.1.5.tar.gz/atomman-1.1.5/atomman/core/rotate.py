def rotate(system, axes):
    """
    Rotate a system by transforming both atomic positions and lattice vectors
    according to axes. 
    
    Arguments:
    system -- atomman.System that is being rotated.
    axes -- three right-handed orthogonal vectors defining the transformation.
            The standard transformation matrix is taken by normalizing axes.
    
    The system returned should be identical to the original
    system, just with a new choice of axes.
