"""Simulate execution in a single CLI run.

Using Selinon simulator is a good way to test you configuration and behaviour locally if you would like to save
some time when debugging or exploring all the possibilities that Selinon offers you. Keep in mind that running
Selinon locally was designed for development purposes and behaviour in general can (and in many cases will) vary.

The key idea behind simulator is to simulate exchange of messages which is done by your Celery broker and Kombu under
the hood of Celery. Thus there are lazily created queues that are referenced by their names (see
selinonlib.simulator.time_queue for implementation details). These queues hold messages prior to time on which they were
scheduled. Under the hood there is used a heap queue to optimize inserting to O(log(N)) in the worst case where N is
number messages currently in the queue. These queues are coupled into QueuePool (selinonlib.simulate.queue_pool) which
encapsulates all queues, keeps their references, instantiates it lazily and provides concurrency safety.

In order to avoid starving, QueuePool keeps track of the queue ("a last used queue") which prevents from
starving messages that were scheduled for the same time (basically a simple round-robin). QueuePool looks for a message
that is not scheduled to the future and can be executed (to do so we get O(N) where N is number of queues being used).

All workers listen on all queues for now. This prevents from waiting on a message that would be never processed.

In order to understand how Simulator works, you need to understand how Celery works. Please refer to Celery
documentation if you are a Celery-newbie.
