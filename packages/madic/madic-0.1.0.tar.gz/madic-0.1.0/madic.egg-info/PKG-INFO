Description: 
        
        Overview
        ========
        madic is a Python package for detecting and correcting interference in targeted
        mass spectrometry data using high-performance Pandas data structures.
        
        Purpose
        =======
        Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM, also known as selected reaction monitoring /
        SRM) data acquired during targeted mass spectrometry experiments can suffer
        from complex interference patterns that hinder accurate quantification. This
        software identifies and corrects interference, as well increases the confidence
        of peptide calls according to three qualities of an ideal chromatogram:
        relative transition ratios similar to synthetic standards, co-elution of all
        individual target transitions with respective stable isotope labeled (SIL)
        transitions, and a distinguished peak relative to the background. Additionally,
        these criteria should be satisfied for all replicate injections of a given
        sample.
