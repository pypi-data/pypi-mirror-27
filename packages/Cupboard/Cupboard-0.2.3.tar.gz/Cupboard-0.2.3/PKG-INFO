Description: 
        Cupboard is an abstracted interface to a variety of 
        key-value storage systems. Developers get tired of 
        having to refactor around different APIs for different 
        storage systems. Cupboard can serve as a drop-in 
        replacement for a dictionary under most usages and can 
        be backed by a variety of KV storage systems. Fine 
        grained control over marshalling and lower level 
        features specific to different backends are 
        configurable in contexts.
