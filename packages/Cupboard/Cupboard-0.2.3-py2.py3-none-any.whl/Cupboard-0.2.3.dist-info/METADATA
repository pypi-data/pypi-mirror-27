Cupboard is an abstracted interface to a variety of 
key-value storage systems. Developers get tired of 
having to refactor around different APIs for different 
storage systems. Cupboard can serve as a drop-in 
replacement for a dictionary under most usages and can 
be backed by a variety of KV storage systems. Fine 
grained control over marshalling and lower level 
features specific to different backends are 
configurable in contexts.
