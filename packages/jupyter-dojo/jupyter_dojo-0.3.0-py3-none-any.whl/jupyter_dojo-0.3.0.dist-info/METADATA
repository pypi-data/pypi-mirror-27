Jupyter Dojo
============

A JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook extension for rendering unittest
results.

This project consists in a nbextension for Jupyter Notebooks and a
labextension for Jupyter Lab. It adds the following features to Jupyter:
\* Test status in toolbar (result of `IPython
Unittest <https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/ipython-unittest>`__) \*
Argument --previous, to move to previous cells after execution \* Timer,
pair programming log, function generation for coding dojo sessions \*
Syntax highlight for ``%%write {mode}`` magic

Prerequisites
-------------

-  JupyterLab ^0.30.0 and/or Notebook >=4.3.0

How to Install
--------------

If you want to install the *Jupyter Notebook* extension:

.. code:: bash

    pip install jupyter_dojo
    jupyter nbextension install --symlink --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo

If you want to install the *Jupyter Lab* extension:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter labextension install @jupyter_dojo/labextension
    jupyter lab build

Note that Jupyter Lab extension API is not stable yet. Thus, it is very
likely that future version will break this extension.

Development
-----------

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e .
    # For JupyterLab
    jupyter labextension link labextension
    jupyter lab build
    # For Notebook
    jupyter nbextension install --symlink --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
