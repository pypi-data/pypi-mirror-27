Manifest Ingest
===============

Author: Tim Santor tsantor@xstudios.agency

Overview
========

Download a project JSON manifest and its media files via S3, SFTP or
HTTP. This tool was developed for internal use on all X Studios
interactive installations which need to have the ability to run
“offline” when there is no active network connection.

Installation
============

::

    pip install manifest-ingest

Or if you want to install a development version:

::

    pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/xstudios/manifest-ingest.git@tag

Usage
=====

Create a Config file
--------------------

Create a config file at ``~/manifest-ingest.cfg``:

.. code:: ini

    [default]
    ; API endpoint which returns JSON
    api_url = http://192.168.1.69:8000/api/v1/music/playlist/
    ; Authorization header needed to access the API (optional)
    api_token = Token API_TOKEN
    ; Regex of key names to search for
    keys = (audio_url|artwork_url)
    ; Override the default manifest filename (optional)
    manifest_filename = manifest.json
    ; Local directory to place downloaded files
    local_dir = ~/target/dir/downloads
    ; Where to place the log file for the application
    log = ~/target/dir/manifest-ingest.log
    ; Max retries to make failed network request before giving up
    max_retries = 5
    ; Base URL for relative paths
    base_url = http://192.168.1.69:8000
    ; Concurrent downloads (number of cores * 2 is usually best)
    concurrent_downloads = 4

    [s3]
    profile_name = default
    bucket_name = BUCKET_NAME
    ; Compare MD5 hash of local file with remote file
    compare_md5 = true

    [sftp]
    server = 192.168.1.100
    username = USERNAME
    password = PASSWORD
    ; Remote directory on server to prepend to file URLs in manifest
    remote_dir = /path/to/project

    [post_download]
    ; Command to run when complete
    command = osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to activate'

..

    NOTE: The config file can be located anywhere that is readable by
    the user. The ``s3``, ``sftp`` and ``post_download`` sections are
    optional.

Usage
-----

.. code:: bash

    manifest-ingest --config=~/manifest-ingest.cfg

Run at Startup (Mac)
--------------------

Create a plist file as
``/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.manifestingest.plist``

.. code:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.user.manifestingest</string>
        <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
            <string>/usr/local/bin/manifest-ingest</string>
            <string>--config</string>
            <string>~/config/manifest-ingest.cfg</string>
        </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
    </plist>

Then run:

.. code:: bash

        launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.manifestingest.plist

Run at Startup (PC)
-------------------

Create a Scheduled Task.

-  **Triggers** - At log on of any user (Delay task for 30 secs)
-  **Actions** - Start a Program: manifest-ingest
   –config=“/Users/Admin/project/config/manifest-ingest.cfg”

On Windows, your bat file to launch a Unity app will look something like
this:

::

    START "" /D "C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\AppName" "AppName.exe" -screen-fullscreen 1 -screen-width 1920 -screen-height 1080

Version History
===============

-  **0.0.1** - Initial release
-  **0.0.2** - Added saving and backup of manifest locally
-  **0.0.3** - Graceful error handling for when a remote file doesn’t
   exist and we attempt to download it
-  **0.0.4** - Added config option to launch command line app when
   download finished
-  **0.0.5** - Added alternate media URL strip method
-  **0.0.6** - Major refactor to make more configurable
-  **0.0.7** - Added single package entry point (all script entry points
   us same config) and Removed ``manifest-quickstart``
-  **0.0.8** - Fixed bug where we expected a api_token in the config
   (not always needed)
-  **0.0.9** - Fixed bug with config setup importing from wrong package
-  **0.1.0** - Fixed bug with run_command call typo
-  **0.1.1** - Fixed url path removal from JSON and correct os paths
-  **0.1.2** - Fixed remote path bug on Windows
-  **0.1.3** - Added elapsed time to log
-  **0.2.0** - Key names are now a regex which is more flexible &
   powerful
-  **0.2.1** - Fixed bug where local filename would be striped of the
   word “media”
-  **0.2.2** - Additional logging
-  **0.2.3** - Removed some logging clutter
-  **0.2.4** - If manifest is empty (eg - {}), then we abort and do not
   launch post_download commands
-  **0.2.5** - Use Keychain (OSX) or Credential Manager (Windows) to get
   SFTP password
-  **0.2.6** - When executing ``manifest-sftp`` over SSH,
   Keychain/Credential Manager do not provide the password so we added
   the ability to manually provide a password via the ``-p`` or
   ``--password`` argument on the command line (use with caution)
-  **0.2.7** - Due to complications with running via command line, we
   removed the Keychain/Credential Manager support. You may now pass
   passwords via Base64 to at least thwart over the shoulder attacks.
   Also changed the way we execute the post download command to be
   non-blocking.
-  **0.2.8** - Improved connection and SSH exception handling and added
   connection retries up to a max number of times.
-  **0.2.9** - Lock in version of pysftp to 0.2.8 due to 0.2.9 HostKeys
   issue.
-  **0.3.0** - Revert to original manifest on SFTP login failure as we
   won’t be able to download the files in the manifest.
-  **0.3.1** - Bug fix with creating remote path correctly on Windows.
-  **0.3.2** - After a failed SSH attempt, revert manifest to original
   and run post_download.
-  **0.3.3** - Added ``manifest_filename`` config so we can save to
   custom named manifest file.
-  **0.3.4** - Lock in version of pysftp to 0.2.8 due to 0.2.9 HostKeys
   issue…again.
-  **0.3.5** - Added ``manifest-s3`` to handle manifests of S3 files.
-  **0.3.6** - Update the way we save the manifest with s3 manifests.
-  **0.4.0** - Complete refactor. Single entrypoint of
   ``manifest-ingest``. Via config can handle S3, SFTP and HTTP manifest
   URL downloads.
-  **0.4.1** - Added ability to compare local and remote MD5 hashes to
   determine if a file is newer on S3.
-  **0.4.2**

   -  **Changed** Changed the way we look for keys with URLs (absolute
      or relative) to regex.
   -  **Changed** Changed the way we strip URL prefixes to make paths
      relative (to to the download directory) to regex.
   -  **Added** Added ability to specify AWS credenttial profile to use
      for S3 in config.

-  **0.4.3** - Added multiprocessing to speed up downloads
-  **0.4.4** - It’s a mystery…
-  **0.4.5** - Added Python 3.6+ support (still works with Python 2.7+)
-  **0.4.6** - No changes. Version bump so we can remove older versions
   from PyPi. Sorry.
-  **0.4.7** - No changes. Version bump so we can remove older versions
   from test PyPi. Sorry.
-  **0.4.8** - Support S3, SFTP and HTTP download URLs.
-  **0.4.9** - Bug fix and handle ports in IPs.
-  **0.5.0** - Bug fix with handling S3 downloads as the bucket name can
   be in the domain name or in the path (eg -
   bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com or s3.amazonaws.com/bucket-name)
