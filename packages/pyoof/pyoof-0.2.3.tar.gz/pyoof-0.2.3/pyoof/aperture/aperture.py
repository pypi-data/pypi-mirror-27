def e_rs(phase):
    """
    Computes the random-surface-error efficiency,
    :math:`\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{rs}`, using the Ruze's equation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phase : `~numpy.ndarray`
        The phase error, :math:`\\varphi(x, y)`, is a two dimensional array (
        one of the solutions from the pyoof package). Its amplitude values are
        in radians.

    Notes
    -----
    Ruze's equation is derived empirically from a fat reflector with Gaussian
    distributed errors, and it expressed as,

    .. math::
        \\varepsilon_\\mathrm{rs} =
        \\mathrm{e}^{-(4\pi\delta_\\mathrm{rms}/\lambda)^2}.

    Where :math:`\delta_\\mathrm{rms}` corresponds to the root-mean-squared
    deviation. The Python function uses the key **phase** because the term
    :math:`4\pi\delta_\\mathrm{rms}/\lambda` corresponds to the phase error.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> pr = 50  # m, Effelsberg primary dish radius
    >>> box_factor = 5
    >>> resolution = 2 ** 8
    >>> # then the x and y array will be defined
