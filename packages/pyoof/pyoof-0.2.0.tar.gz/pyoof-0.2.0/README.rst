pyoof is a Python package that contains all needed tools to perform out-of-focus (OOF) holography on astronomical beam maps for single-dish radio telescopes. It is based on the original OOF holography papers,

* [Out-of-focus holography at the Green Bank Telescope](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/ps/2007/14/aa5765-06.ps.gz)
* [Measurement of antenna surfaces from in- and out-of-focus beam maps using astronomical sources](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/ps/2007/14/aa5603-06.ps.gz)

and [software](https://github.com/bnikolic/oof) developed by [Bojan Nikolic](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~bn204/oof/).

The pyoof package calculates the aperture phase distribution map from a set of beam maps (telescope observations), at a relatively good signal-to-noise as described by B. Nikolic. By using a nonlinear least squares minimization, a convenient set of polynomials coefficients can be found to represent the aperture distribution. Once this is calculated the aberrations on the primary dish are known.

We are currently testing the pyoof package at the [Effelsberg radio telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effelsberg_100-m_Radio_Telescope) :satellite:.

pyoof is still in the early-development stage. While much of the
functionality is already working as intended, the API is not yet stable.
Nevertheless, we kindly invite you to use and test the library and we are
grateful for feedback. Note, that work on the documentation is still ongoing.

Installation
============

The easiest and more convenient way to install the pyoof package is via `pip`

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyoof

The installation is also possible from the source. Clone the GitHub repository and execute!

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

I believe in the future :smile:, so please install Python 3.
Unfortunately, a windows version of the package is currently not available.

Dependencies
============

So far the pyoof package uses the common Python packages, it is recommended to install the `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_ distribution first, although using `pip` is also fine.

pyoof has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__ 3.5 or later

- `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__: Used for the package
  installation.

- `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ 1.11 or later

- `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`__: 0.15 or later

- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__: 1.3 or later (2.0 recommended)

- `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`__ 2.6 or later

- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ 1.5 or later: To provide plotting
  functionality that `~pyoof.pathprof.helper` enhances.
