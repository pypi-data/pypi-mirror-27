============
Installation
============

Install scopus from PyPI:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install scopus

or directly from the GitHub repository (may be unstable):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/scopus-api/scopus

You need to have a license or institutional access to access Scopus.  Additionally, you need an API which you can obtain from http://dev.elsevier.com/myapikey.html after registration.  On first usage, `scopus` asks you to enter your key which will be stored in `~/.scopus/my_scopus.py`.

See extended description and examples in the :doc:`Examples </examples>` section.
