        Features
        --------
        
        * Mode 1:
                In this mode user handles and ratings are stored in the disk when user enters them 
                for the first time so that the user need not enter them in the future and also it 
                provides a comparison summary between old and new ratings.It is the default mode.
        
        
        * Mode 2:
                If it is not possible to maintain log, users can still view their
                ratings by simply selecting competitive programming site option number
                and entering handle.
