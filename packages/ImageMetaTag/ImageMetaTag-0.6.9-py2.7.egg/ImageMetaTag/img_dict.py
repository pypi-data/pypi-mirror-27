'''
This submodule contains the :class:`ImageMetaTag.ImageDict` class, and functions for 
preparing instances of it.

The purpose of an :class:`ImageMetaTag.ImageDict` is to sort the image metadata, supplied to
:func:`ImageMetaTag.savefig` and usually stored in a database file, into a useful form that
can quickly and easily be presented as a webpage by :func:`ImageMetaTag.webpage.write_full_page`.

An easy example of creating a webpage, using an ImageDict is shown in
`simplest_image_dict.py <simple.html>`_

class ImageDict(object):
    '''
    A class which holds a heirachical dictionary of dictionaries, and the associated
    methods for appending/removing dictionaries from it.

    The expected use case for the dictionary is to represent a large set of images,
    which can be organised by their metadata tags.

    When used in this way, the ImageDict module contains functions to produce web
    pages for browsing the images.

    The input_dict should be a heirachical dictionary of dictionaries, containing
    the image metadata, in the required order. In order to convert a flat dictionary
    of metadata items, use :func:`ImageMetaTag.dict_heirachy_from_list`

    Options:
     * level_names - a list of the tagnames, in full, giving a name/description of what \
                     the metadata item means. Ordered by level of the input dict.
     * selector_widths - a list of html strings giving the widths of each selector in the \
                         output webpage. CURRENTLY UNUSED!
     * selector_animated - an integer indicating which selector on the output webpage is \
                           to be animated.
     * animation_dicrection - +1 indicates the animation moves forwards, -1 indicates it \
                              moves backwards.

    Objects:
     * dict - the heirachical dictionary of dictionaries containing the image structure.
     * keys - a list of keys for each level of the dict, within a dictionary using the level \
              number as the keys.
     * level_names - If supplied, this stores the full names of the items in keys.
     * selector_animated - the level index which will be animated on the output webpage.
     * animation_direction - the direction of animation (+1 for forward, -1 for backward).
     * selector_widths - a list of desired widths on the output web page (CURRENTLY UNUSED).
