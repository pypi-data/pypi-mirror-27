'''
ImageMetaTag is a python package built around a wrapper for
`savefig <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html?highlight=savefig#matplotlib.pyplot.savefig>`_
in
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_, which adds metadata tags to supported image file formats.

Once the images have been tagged, it can also be used to manage an
`SQL database <https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html>`_ of images and their metadata.
The image metadata can be used to produce an
:class:`ImageMetaTag.ImageDict` object: a structured/heirachical dictionary of dictionaries
which can be used to easily create web pages to present large numbers of images.

As the image metadata tagging process involves reading the image using the Image library,
a few common image post-processing options are included such as cropping, logo addition and
colour palette manipulation to reduce filesizes.
