Rabbit-Bot: Windows Bot Engine (Human Input Simulator)
======================================================

Purposes and Features

Rabbit is designed to use programs to simulate human inputs. Which might
be useful in some boring repeating tasks or game bots.

This project contains two sub-projects:

-  Rabbit App: An application with embedded scripting support, an
   alternative of QuickMacro.
-  Rabbit-Bot Packages: Packages for Python (PyPI), JavaScript (NPM),
   Lua (LuaRocks).
