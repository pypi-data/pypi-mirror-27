        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Pynotebook is a library for creating notebook applications in
        wxpython. A notebook is a document which can contain program code,
        text and graphics.  Notebooks are a pleasant way to develop and
        document code and to store ideas.
        
        Unlike other python notebook interfaces such as jupyter or spyder, pnb
        is very lightweight and can be easily to embeded in wxpython
        applications.
        
        Although python is the native language for pynotebook, it is
        relatively easy to extend it to other scripting languages.
        
        Applications using the Pynotebook library are
        
        - pnb (a python notebook application) and
        - rnb (an experimental notebook for the r programming language)
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Pynotebook does not need a webbrowser, c extensions or anything except
        python and `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_. Pynotebook has a
        single dependency (wxpython) is therefore easy to embed and
        distribute.
