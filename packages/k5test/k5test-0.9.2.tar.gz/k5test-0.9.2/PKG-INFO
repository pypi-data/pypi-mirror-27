Description: K5Test
        ======
        
        *k5test* is a library for setting up self-contained Kerberos 5 environments,
        and running Python unit tests inside those environments.  It is based on
        the file of the same name found alongside the MIT Kerberos 5 unit tests.
        
        Using k5test to set up a Kerberos 5 deployment
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        *k5test* can be used to set up a self-contained MIT Kerberos 5 environment.
        This is useful for testing applications without having to manipulate existing
        Kerberos realms, or having to set up a full Kerberos deployment by hand.
        
        To set up a realm, use the `k5test.K5Realm` class.  The constructor accepts
        several useful arguments for controlling which parts get set up; refer to the
        inline documentation for more information.
        
        Using k5test to run unit tests
        ------------------------------
        
        Instead of having test cases inherit from `unittest.TestCase`, inherit from
        `k5test.KerberosTestCase`, which will automatically set up a Kerberos 5 environment,
        before the test case, and tear it down afterwards.
        
        Additionally, several decorators are defined.  the
        `k5test.gssapi_extension_test(extension_name, human_readable_name)` decorator
        (which requires `python-gssapi`) allows you to skip tests with installations that don't
        support a particular GSSAPI extension.  The the
        `k5test.krb_minversion_test(target_version, problem_name)` decorator allows you to skip tests
        when running a version of krb5 less that the required version.  The
        `k5test.krb_plugin_test(plugin_type, plugin_name)` decorator allows you to skip tests for
        installations that don't have a particular plugin installed.
