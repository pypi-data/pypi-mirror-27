Description: peppy python package
        ====================

        ``peppy`` is the official python package for handling **Portable
        Encapsulated Projects** or **PEP**\ s. **PEP** is a standardized format
        for describing sample-intensive project metadata. ``peppy`` provides a
        python API for this format to load **PEP**-formatted metadata into
        python.
        
        Complete documentation and API for the ``peppy`` python package is at
        `peppy.readthedocs.io <http://peppy.readthedocs.io/>`__.
        
        Reference documentation for standard **PEP** format is at
        `pepkit.github.io <https://pepkit.github.io/>`__.
        
        peppy and looper
        ================
        
        The ``peppy`` package was originally developed in conjuction with
        `looper <http://github.com/pepkit/looper>`__, a pipeline submission
        engine. The two projects have now been divided so that ``peppy`` can be
        used independently of ``looper``. ``looper`` imports ``peppy`` to handle
        its project metadata loading and is therefore compatible with standard
        **PEP** format.
