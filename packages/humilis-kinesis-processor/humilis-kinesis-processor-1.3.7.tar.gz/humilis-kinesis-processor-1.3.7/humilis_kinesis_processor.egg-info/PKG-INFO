        A `humilis <https://github.com/humilis/humilis>`__ plugin to deploy a
        `Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/lambda/>`__ function that
        maps events in a `Kinesis <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kinesis/>`__
        event stream using a list of Python callables.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install humilis-kinesis-processor
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        Assuming you have
        `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ installed:
        
        ::
        
            make develop
        
        Configure humilis::
        
            .env/bin/humilis configure --local
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Unit tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To run the local test suite::
        
            make test
        
        
        Integration tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Before running the integration test suite you need to set a few deployment 
        secrets using the command::
        
            s3keyring set [group]/[STAGE] [key] [secret]
        
        
        In group ``humilis-kinesis-processor`` the following secrets need to be set:
        
        * ``sentry/dsn``: The `Sentry DSN <https://docs.getsentry.com/hosted/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn>`__.
        
        
        By the default, the integration tests will deploy on a stage called ``DEV`` so
        the command to set the Sentry DSN is::
        
            s3keyring set humilis-kinesis-processor:DEV sentry.dsn [SENTRYDSN]
        
        
        To run the integration test suite::
        
            make testi
        
        The command above will deploy a Kinesis processor to your AWS account, and will
        also create additional resources (such as several Kinesis streams) needed to
        test that the deployment was successful. Once deployed, the integration tests
        will run, and once they have completed the test environment will be destroyed.
        
        If you do not want the test environment to be destroyed after tests have 
        completed you should run instead::
        
           make testi DESTROY=no
        
        You can also modify the name of the deployment stage by setting the ``STAGE``
        environment variable. For instance, to deploy to a ``TEST`` stage::
        
           make testi STAGE=TEST
