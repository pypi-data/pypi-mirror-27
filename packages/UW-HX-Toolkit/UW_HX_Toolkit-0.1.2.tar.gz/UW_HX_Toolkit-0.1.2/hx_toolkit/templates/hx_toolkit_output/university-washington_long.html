            &lt;p&gt;Established in downtown Seattle a decade after the city&#39;s founding, the university was created to aid in the economic development and urbanization of Seattle. Its two other campuses are located in Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with over 26 university libraries, the UW Tower office building, art centers, museums, lecture halls, laboratories, sport stadiums and conference centers. The University offers bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees through its 140 departments, organized into various colleges and schools.
