            <p>Email messages to faculty, mentors, and potential employers should be brief and professional.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a useful subject line; a title like “meeting” will not be helpful for people who receive dozens of emails per day.</li>
<li>Use a greeting at the beginning: You can’t go wrong with “Hello” or “Dear <their name>.” Default to a formal title (e.g. Mr., Mrs., Dr.) unless you are already on a first-name basis.</li>
<li>AVOID ALL CAPS! Unless you really are intending to shout&#8230;.</li>
<li>Double-check attachments – are they attached? Are they titled appropriately?</li> 
<li>Develop an email signature that includes more information about you, such as a link to your online profile or portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking time to present yourself and communicate carefully will help you make good first impressions, both online and in-person.</p>
